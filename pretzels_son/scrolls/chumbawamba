I’ve spent some time creating meme-style images of Chumbawamba lyrics from some of my favorite songs off of their discography. Here are six of those pieces that you can print onto a sheet of sticker or magnet paper- or just wheatpaste them somewhere.

I use paper that I can find in store & simple at home printers to print my stickers. It’s also best to laminate them as well.

Songs featured in these stickers:
