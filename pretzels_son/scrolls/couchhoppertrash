# Help your couch hopper deal with their own trash

The first thing you’ll need to support your couch hopper’s attempt at a sustainable consumption lifestyle is a compost bin. One issue a person on the road doesn’t want to have is a lot of food waste with not a **compost bin** to be found. & in 60 years, when top soil is no more, you’ll be glad you started composting today. Why produce methane, when you could make soil with that material?

The next most important set up is a **fire pit** for trash that is neither compostable or recyclable, but safe to burn. This will be mostly pizza boxes & I guess we could burn cardboard that has plastic coating if we want to push it (they aren’t recyclable). It’d be nice to create some outdoor hang out space anyway, with your house being a bit more cramped than you’re used to.

Now, you need a **metal recycling bin**. The great thing about recycling metal is that you just leave it in your back alley & your neighborhood metal recyclers will load it away for you sporadically throughout the week- you don’t even have to pay them. You could even mark your metal recycling area & encourage your neighbors to leave their junk metal out for whoever. That’s keeping money in your hood, metal out of the landfill & creating more space to connect with others. We’ll always need to recycle metal, but will we always have landfills to fill up? I sure hope not.

Make it easier to sort your **plastic & paper recycling** by having a recycling container nearby your trashcan. If you don’t already recycle, your couch hopper may just take it all with them when they leave & find a bin out in the commons. No worries- they typically exist in the commons anyway & know where to find what they’re looking for… most of the time.

They may also be interested in any **reusable container** that you would usually throw out- remember they don’t buy disposable items and they don’t throw out reusable ones. Wash those off and set them to the side- or ask them if they have the capacity to do that chore themselves. Who knows, you might even take after them and stop buying things like foil & resealable bags after you develop a decent reusable storage area in your space.
