# Replicable Zine Library
 
[.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/pibrary/main/pretzels+son/pdf/Pretz%20Ellison's%20Replicable%20Art.pdf)

I make portable zine libraries. They each fit a chosen topic & are designed to be replicated easily. I can be commissioned through my art project ***Pretzel’s Son***

Below is a link to a few of my favorite zines.

Some pdfs might not be in exactly zine format & you may have to do some tinkering in a program that allows you to choose the “booklet” setting before printing. Typically, I can do this with Adobe PDF Reader.

A few articles featured in this library:

 - Template for mini zine making
 - 3 minute game
 - Against Stigma, Not Sex Work
 - The Consent Checklist
 - Cooperative Scavenging
 - Grieving Overdose
 - To Heal We Must Resist
 - What to do when you have been abusive
 - Psychedelic Peer Support Guide
 - My contact card
