# Compost Bin

[1Compost bin blueprint.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/pibrary/main/pretzels+son/pdf/1Compost%20bin%20blueprint.pdf)

The first step I take to make a compost bin is scavenge for dumpster wood.

What to look for:

 - 12 feet of post board, which can be 2x2 or 4x4 or anything square-ish.
 - Enough 1x4 or 1x6 boards to make about 12 boards around 3 feet each.


Also need:

 - Screws, a drill, some type of saw

Optional:

 - 3-4 1 inch thick boards, at least 8 inches wide
 - Chicken wire
 - Tinsnips
 - Staple gun

Look for dumpster wood on the curb every trash day. Keep an eye out for those large dumpsters that people rent out, especially.

Now that I have my wood, I cut all post boards & outer boards to the same size, which can range from 2’ 6” to 3’.

Now I lay 2 post boards out parallel to eachother, the length of the outer boards apart.

Then, I place 3-4 outer boards over the 2 post boards, equidistant apart, 1 inch from the top & bottom of the post boards. I screw the outer boards into the post boards. Repeat with the remaining posts. These will be the 2 opposite sides of the bin.

I connect the opposite sides of the bin by screwing in 3-4 boards equidistant apart, 1 inch from the top & bottom, into the rear posts. This is the back side of the bin.

To secure the front side of the bin, I take the final outer board & screw it 1 inch from the bottom of both of the front posts.

The optional part of the bin is the sliding planks in the front. These can be wedged in between a u-shaped post board(seen below) or in between 2 post boards.

Another optional part is lining the inside of the bin with chicken wire, which requires tin-snips & a staple gun.
