# TRASH ROBOT HYPE PAGE

I want to promote creators of art, music, technology, crafts, science, culture, cooking, gardening, anarchy, chaos, games.  Think of this as a collection of fan pages, with links to promote creators in whatever way benefits them the most(links to patreon, band camp, cash apps, email list signup, or *independent* web pages(not Facebook).  The point of this is not to get promoted by TRASH ROBOT, but to prove that we as creators *can* promote each other directly.  I hype you and you hype  me.  If that is shown to work, creators can form organic networks from one person to the next with no landlord like Tiktok.  Because ultimately if this scales up, creators can just ask for direct donations and promote each other, and we can directly distribute our work to the public who support us directly.  This requires no app or platform, or logins--it's just the good old fashioned World Wide Web and the social network of actual humans who make things.  

This is basically creators on Tiktok who I like and who I want to promote.  Send them a few bucks! And if we're mutuals on Tiktok and you want a link, just let me know what you want and I'll post it.  If this starts to go anywhere, I can teach others to copy.  I will promote companies, business, whatever.  As long as I think something is cool or useful or is made by an independent creator I want to support I'll put it up here.  Want a link? you can email  [operator@trashrobot.org](mailto:operator@trashrobot.org), and feel free to send links to images as well if you want, just as long as there is no copyright.  Anything you send to me should be considered Public Domain, as is everything I post to this web site, without exception.  

Or you can DM trash_robot on tiktok, or lafelabs on instagram.
