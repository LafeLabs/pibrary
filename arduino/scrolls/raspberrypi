## Install arduino

```
sudo apt-get install arduino
```

go get the Arduino software at:

and download "Linux ARM 32 bits".

Open a terminal and go to the home directory:

```
cd ~
```

Go to downloads folder:
```
cd Downloads
```
list the files with 
```
ls
```
See the name of an archive with a name like "arduino-####-linuxarm.tar.xz", where #### is a version number.

extract with 
```
tar -xf arduino-####-linuxarm.tar.xz
```

move the extracted information to opt directory(directory for package installation)

```
sudo mv arduino-#### /opt
```

then run the install script:
```
sudo /opt/arduino-####/install.sh
```
