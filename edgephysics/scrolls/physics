# what is physics?

Physics is the study of the most fundamental elements of reality.  But what does "fundamental" mean?  The more fundamental a body of knowledge is, the more other things it affects.  We say that the laws of physics as it was defined before the mid twentieth century are fundamental because of how universally they impact the rest of science.  All biology, chemistry, engineering, astronomy and so on can be understood in important ways using forces, fields, measurement science, thermodynamics and so on.  This is why this was considered "fundamental".  

However, from the late twentieth through the early twenty first century, physics has gone down a reductionist path which now fails this test of being fundamental.  Discoveries about quarks and black holes, unlike those about heat and light in the prior century, have no impact whatsoever on anyone else in society outside of their specific sub-discipline.  People may read the paper and say they have learned something but there is no *impact*.  

We define physics therefore to be the body of knowledge as it existed before this reductionist trap, in the mid twentieth century at the absolute latest.  We define physics as a collection of both experimental tools and theoretical tools, as well as a general approach to problem solving.  We then retain this idea of always pushing knowledge toward that which is the most fundamental, based on these tools, but with a more careful definition of fundamental. 

The core areas of theoretical study include thermodynamics, classical mechanics, electromagnetism, light and other radiation, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and solid state physics.  We also include mathematical methods in physics and the core math curriculum such as calculus, differential equations, numerical methods, linear algebra, foundational mathematics, complex analysis and differential geometry.  Experimentally, we include machining and machine design, welding and brazing, electronic fabrication, vacuum and high pressure plumbing, instrument design and construction, and optics.
