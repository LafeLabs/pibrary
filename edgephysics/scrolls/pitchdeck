# pitchdeck

20 slides or so
 
this is a deck to raise grant money into the company to do what we do.  We are pitching why our approach delivers value to the under-resourced communities rather than pulling individuals out from those communities to join Big Tech.  This is a longer form of the elevator pitch with some elements of the white paper.  This has budget information and specific proposals for free networks in Denver serving the homeless and poor along major corridors, as well as connecting up our network of people in the Denver metro area.  Specific.  Includes me and other people. Details of money.  We are NOT selling equity, and never will.  We raise money only for direct operations.  We can pay people to do anything that furthers those goals.  The LLC will remain a 1 person LLC.  I can be employed separately to do this work in addition, as a "job" aside from the LLC.
