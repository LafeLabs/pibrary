***this length is about right but it's not focused enough, doesn't have a clear pitch yet*** This might be too long, and should perhaps be three paragraphs.

 - pandemic + climate = exposing fragile centrally controlled networks
 - abolish all oil, gas and global manufacturing supply webs by 2050
 - edge physics is science studying the most fundamental elements of the physical world at the edge of the Network
 - we directly convert trash into physics demonstrations which illuminate all physical elements of our edge-based civilization and deploy them locally
 - all money raised is used to directly benefit under-resourced communities to address the Digital Divide, while documenting everything and publishing to the Public Domain on the Geometron network
 
The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web.  The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the *exact same materials* to every corner of the globe.  The Internet has allowed knowledge to propagate from anywhere to anywhere instantly.  When we combine these two things, we have an opportunity unprecedented in human history to build a very technologically advanced civilization without any global supply chains at all.  

We believe that the global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the *edges* of the network.  We seek to create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy.  We aim to build *everything* this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all.  

This plan will enable us to completely eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by the year 2050.  We will build will our infrastructure at the level of small local communities, but replicate it freely across the whole world.   We will fund this also at the local level, forming our networks inside existing institutions at the local level, and providing value which will be locally compensated.  

These activities, taken together, constitute a movement towards the edges of the network which makes up our civilization.  The project proposed here consists of building a program in "edge physics", or physics of materials we find everywhere in the modern age in waste streams(cars, smart phones, old clothes, food trash, plastic packaging, scrap metal).  We both build things *from* these waste streams and build things to study them, creating a whole discipline of physics centered on the world directly around us as it exists today.
