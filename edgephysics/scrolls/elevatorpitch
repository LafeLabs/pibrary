# Elevator Pitch: 

**90 seconds max**
  
Edge physics is a Colorado LLC headquartered in Denver, solely owned and operated by Dr. Lafe Spietz.  We deliver free educational resources to address the Digital Divide.  We train people in under-resourced communities to build their own free edge network infrastructure and technology which benefits their community directly.  Unlike tech boot camps which are designed to create workers in existing tech companies, we build technology education to be locally sustainable, building full stack networks which support the *local* economy directly.  

We build free and open mesh networks linking the most public spaces in any given space and connecting them to the Internet.  We create a network of Raspberry Pi based web servers which serve documents over the mesh network also freely available to everyone which can be used to facilitate all networking at the local level.  Just as the big tech companies facilitate commerce at a global scale and are supported by that commerce, we support commerce at a local scale.  Our goal is not to build either a big tech company or even a series of small tech companies, but to have networks be shared infrastructure maintained by local community members for the benefit of all, using existing budgets both public and private.

This is the seed from which the true edge physics will grow.  As we teach people technology, we will also teach applied physics directed toward manufacturing with waste streams and distributed via the same edge network.  We will build and share all the elements of full Edge Physics: media, thermal machines, gas and fluid machines, optics, power, and so on.  These will be delivered as student demonstration projects as part of our educational program, and distributed globally using both our edge networks and existing media platforms.  As with the edge network, edge physics will be funded entirely by grants for community development, training people in technology and science for direct benefit to their community rather than employment in the centralized economy.  Again as with the edge network, our model will be to teach people to do things that self-sustain, by building manufacturing capacity based on local waste streams and open source platforms.
