# funding
 
Edge funding means all of our cash flow comes from directly in the community where we are located.  This can be small businesses, private citizen donations, local government, local libraries, local public schools, local religious organizations and charities, or internal educational funding in a university.   We aim for every element of our work to benefit directly one of those stake holders, who will therefore support us based on that benefit.
