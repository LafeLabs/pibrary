# funding
 
Edge funding means all of our cash flow comes from directly in the community where we are located.  This can be small businesses, private citizen donations, local government, local libraries, local public schools, local religious organizations and charities, or internal educational funding in a university.   We aim for every element of our work to benefit directly one of those stake holders, who will therefore support us based on that benefit.

To seed this system, we can raise grants into research and educational institutions.  These grants are not research grants.  They are grants designed for addressing the "digital divide", the inequality generated by unequal access to network resources.  

The grant money is primarily to pay for generating freely distributed online content which teaches anyone in the world what they need to know to build our system.  This includes learning full stack web development, wireless network engineering, machine design, manufacturing, electronics and physics, all of which can address digital divide issues.  Grant money also pays for us to travel into communities and train people directly and build out infrastructure for local people to use.  

We aim to get as many grants like this as possible into as many different institutions as possible, through as many different faculty, departments and students as possible to spread it all across the world.  This basic structure of using grant money to train people to build science tools from waste streams should scale across the globe, as many governments, NGOs and corporations are concerned with attempting to address these issues. 

As grant money seeds the network and we build more and more things of value, we can start to grow into more complete manufacturing hubs, which can provide more value to local communities, making them completely locally self-sufficient.  As long as each hub of edge industry generates more value than is needed to keep it going, we can expect communities to do whatever they can to keep us operating.  This can be monetary compensation(simply making and selling things, or charging money for media promotion) or it can be direct material support with local land owners letting us use their land for free, local farmers giving us food and so on.
