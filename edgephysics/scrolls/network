# network
 
 - raspberry pi in a bag on the side of the road run from solar power
 - free mesh networks in public spaces, run from off grid power
 - software which replicates from one raspberry pi to the next, with no central data center of any kind
 - shared freely copied resources like github, pastebin
 - shared freely copied hosted domains representing a specific geographic location(e.g. southbroadway.net, maplelawn.net, kstreet.xyz), and physical media pointing to the domain
 - all of this uses the software I have written which freely copies all the files from server to server entirely with client-side browser commands
 - self-replicating media: textiles, cardboard, clay, plastic trash
 - free public robots which can print stamps to stamp into trash
 - the street network as a location in the main pibrary server structure
 - the factory of self-replicating things
 - the network of key players including waste management, machining, electronic technicians, junk yards, high schools, colleges, mutual aid groups, local homeless and busker community
 - physical network of trash which is provided to makers who make things and provide them to the community 

The network is self-supporting.  We use this network to create links of commerce and free exchange in a local community and ask for direct material support from the community who benefits.  The most sustainable way to do that is to simply train the local stake holders such as local government, small business, schools, and non profits in how to set up and operate the system.  

The initial system consists of all off the shelf hardware: the raspberry pi, solar panels, mesh network nodes, commodity cloud storage, and physical media.  Eventually, as [the road map of the electrical research](scrolls/electrical) progresses, we will replace all of these off the shelf components with those we can create ourselves locally using waste streams.   


This section needs a breakdown of the budget for Starlink vs. if the same money was spent at the edge, with large numbers of 100-500 dollar investments rather than a centralized space based system.

Same breakdown for Facebook: revenue, users, advertising, how that scales down to a single street corner or neighborhood.  Architecture graph: data centers, layers of tech all of which has predatory and wasteful elements, vs. our system with off grid raspberry pi's out in public on free mesh networks.  Economics breakdown of a strip mall, business district, area of city especially around a financial network node.  We are definitely using this to get direct money from investors but not for equity, for building out free edge networks in the immediate physical environment of their offices.  Hence we target financial districts of down towns, evaluate the local economics of those spaces.  Sand Hill Road. the Embarcadero.  Lower Manhattan. Midtown. Greenwich, CT.  The City of London.

Specific deployment plans: build free public mesh networks in public spaces, available 24/7.  Do this in nyc, philly, dc, denver, anchorage.  Put solar powered raspberry pi's on the network, and teach people to use them, share them, replicate them, program them.  Very specifically we want to make mesh networks rooftop to rooftop going down Broadway and also Colfax in Denver, with Raspberry Pi's stationed in coffee shops as permanent installations. We will raise money to pay for the connections to the Internet as well as all the hardware for the repeaters and hubs. We will train passerby and give out free self-replicating media.  People replicate our physical media which points to the domains which contain whatever they are trying to replicate.  This creates free self-replicating media which anyone can use to promote whatever they're doing.  We do this for free and ask for donations.  Self replicating media includes the clothes, flags, clay tokens, printed trash, cardboard signs, and books.
