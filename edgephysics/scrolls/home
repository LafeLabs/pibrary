#  The Edge Physics Network

White Paper draft by Lafe Spietz

## 1. Introduction

The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web. The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the exact same materials to every corner of the globe. We can and should leverage the power of this uniform distribution of waste streams to totally eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by 2050.

We believe that the global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the edges of the network. We seek to create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy. We aim to build everything this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all. 

Building this new civilization is a long term project, in which progress will be measured in decades and centuries, not years.  In order to have the maximum impact on the long term trajectory of this process of transformation we focus on the most fundamental of all disciplines: physics.  We are creating a new way of doing physics in which all equipment is fabricated using waste stream materials, and all our work is geared toward building a universal system of knowledge on which we can base our new civilization.


## 2. What is Edge Physics? 

Physics is a search for the most fundamental laws of nature.  Between the seventeenth and mid twentieth centuries, the quest to use reductionist methods to always delve "deeper" into the structure of the Universe was incredibly fruitful.  We found that the products of this process had both an enormous impact on other sciences and on the technologies which have come to define our civilization.  We found that simple mathematical expressions could be used to both understand and control almost any element of the world we find around us.  This yielded both a fundamental world view which other sciences could build on and a tool kit which technology creators could use to build new things.  We dove deeply into the structure of the smallest things with atomic, nuclear and particle physics as well as the biggest things with astrophysics.  All through this process we continued to make progress on all fronts, benefiting humanity and our understanding of our world in a broad way.

And then, in the later half of the twentieth century, something started to change.  Increasingly, physics became a close system.  We built bigger and bigger machines to probe what we claimed was "deeper and deeper" into the structure of the Universe.  But as we did this we departed more and more from the realm of reality we actually inhabit as humans.  As we entered the realm of what came to be known as "big science" we were promised that building bigger and bigger and more specialized experiments would give the same magnitude of results as earlier physics had. That is, that it would illuminate the rest of science and society.  This has proven not to be the case.  Big science has produced work which is useful to the rest of science in some limited capacity, but compared to things like quantum theory or atomic physics the contributions have been insignificant.  

Many people might dispute this claim, of course, and there are plenty of small examples of contributions from big science.  But to justify the claim made here we will define what it means for something to be "fundamental".  What made the physics from the earlier centuries fundamental was that it had a direct impact on other things greater than those things have on physics.  That is to say, a biologist needs to know about light and fluid flow more than a physicist needs to know about insect wings.  A chemist needs the quantum theory of electrons in a molecule more than a physicist needs to know everything about details of reaction rate calculations.  A mechanical engineer needs Newtons laws more than a physicist needs to know how to build an engine.  Loosely speaking, we can think of a space of bodies of knowledge, where there is a gradient of "fundamentality" which increases as a body has greater impact on other bodies.  

By this narrow definition, modern "pure" physics is remarkably non-fundamental.  The latest results about quarks, supersymmetry, dark matter and so on have zero impact on any other field even in physics, much less in the rest of science and technology or society at large.  Lord Kelvin famously stated that all science was either physics or "stamp collecting", and physicists in big science have joined the ranks of the stamp collectors in that they produce things that no one outside their field can even understand, much less make any use of.

At the same time that big science was taking over "pure physics", applied physics started to depart more and more from this type of physics, and a larger and larger fraction of physicists worked in industrial labs building new technologies using existing physics, such as the laser and the transistor.  This project of applying quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, and early particle physics to practical technology problems was also wildly successful and gave us much of the technology which now defines our society.  It was "fundamental" through the second half of the twentieth century in the same way that pure physics was in the prior age.   That is, things like the laser and transistor had impact on every other thing people do: science, technology, industry, and culture.  It changed the very structure of how we exist as a species on this planet.  

And yet applied physics is now suffering the same fate as pure physics for the same reasons.  We pushed too hard in one direction which had been productive in the past and lost sight of what it really means to be "fundamental".  The period of applied physics from the late twentieth century through the first two decades of the twenty first have seen a descent increasingly into fantasy worlds of an imagined future which we have been unable to deliver on.  From quantum computers to space elevators made of nanotubes, we have built the same social structures of rigid big science that exist in pure physics, with the same results.  We write papers that no one outside some very narrow field can understand, which have no impact on anyone else's work or on society at large.  

What we are proposing in this paper is a return of physics to its goal of creating a simple set of laws of the Universe which are as fundamental as possible.  However, what we propose is a more intentional definition of "fundamental".  We start from the assumption that the purpose of all science is ultimately to improve the human condition.  This can mean both technological means to improve the lives of all humans directly, but it can also mean creating a shared understanding which gives as many people as possible the satisfaction and power of being able to make sense of their world.  

Centering our cosmology on our own lives and the lives of the people and other living things around us, we now return to the goal physics has claimed but never delivered on: unification.  We aim now not to unify knowledge in some narrow sense of subatomic particles and black holes, but in the human-centered sense of everything we interact with as people.  We aim to create a unified way to exist in the world.  We claim unification to include a way of life, a way of thinking about life, and an approach to problem solving.  Our aim of unification in physics is to create the smallest possible set of skills and knowledge which has the largest possible impact on our ability to live better lives.  We set this as our aim and then conduct research to try to get closer to this ideal as we progress. 

Edge physics is physics both conducted at the edge of the global network and about the edge.  We use tools we can find right where we are, concepts we can share with the people directly around us, and study things we can directly observe around us.  The closer physics is to ourselves, and the more impact it has on our lives and the lives of people close to us the more fundamental it is.  The rest of this document is a proposal for how we will go about building this discipline and spreading it and growing it.  
 
## 3. Factories of the Future

As we build the basis of our system of knowledge, we must visualize the end product.  The product is the basic unit of our civilization, the means by which we produce technology in a post-extraction world.  This is the Edge Factory, the factory which produces all the artifacts we need for a good life using only the waste streams and energy found in in our immediate environment.  

What do we want from the factory of the future?  We want machines which do medicine, food production, creating comfortable habitats, media and networking, transportation, sanitation, textile production, and water processing.  And first and foremost we need machines which make machines.  This is the most fundamental machine technology.  

Machine self-replication has become something of a fantasy in the age of computers, where people imagine magical futuristic robots building themselves with total automation.  If we take a more realistic view of machine replication, machines have replicated themselves for all of human history.  Early human tools were stone and wood and bone tools used to make more stone and wood and bone tool.  The industrial revolution brought into being the machine shop factory, in which machines make machines, always with the help of skilled workers, and with a constant stream of fresh raw material.  Only with the latest waves of globalization has this model started to break down, where machines can only be created with the help of the vast globally interconnected web of systems.  

In order to break all the other links in the supply web, we must first build this fundamental building block of the edge machine shop and machine factory.  The edge machine shop is one of the core bridges that connect the physics program we are building today with the global factory system we are aiming to build.  We cannot fully envision what the end product will look like.  What we do now to get there is start with something we can figure out how to build at a smaller scale which has immediate value narrowly for edge physics, as will be discussed below.  

One of the other most fundamental technological elements we need our factories to build are those for manipulating fluids, such as pumps, valves, manifolds and so on.  We need to have a modular system for building biological reactors so that we can replicate all the products of modern medicine, which are generally produced using complex webs of production using e-coli.  The factories of the future will need to have some kind of large scale production of medicine of all kinds, but to get there what we aim to do as physicists is simply build tools to empower those in the life sciences to do what they already do but at the edges of the global network.  This means we need to build temperature and pressure control and a wide range of measurement technologies which can be used to extract information from living systems we use to make things.  We will work over the coming decades to build strong collaboration with those in the life sciences to keep building whatever tools they need to build more useful systems of living production, making better medicines in more efficient ways, as well as connecting this system to our food production and other types of product. As with all elements of our system, replication is a goal.  We want living systems which are backed up by information systems simple enough that we can understand them, manage them and most importantly replicate them, teaching others to copy the whole thing.  

The basic motive power for our machines will revert back to what it was before the rise of the global empires of petrochemicals: direct use of energy in the environment.  We will return to water wheels and windmills as direct drivers of machines which we use to make things.  But we also want to build a universal heat engine which we can run from concentrated solar heat energy as well as burning organic materials, geothermal, or any other source of heat we might find.  There might be many ways to do this, but initially we aim to build a technological system based on the Striling engine, a closed heat engine which compresses a working gas to convert a heat gradient to mechanical work.  One thing that is fantastic about these engines is that they can also be run backwards, operating as refrigerators and air conditioners as well as engines.  We aim to build a factory which has the minimum machines required to build Striling engines from trash which can run machines which can build more Stirling engines.  As in all our technology, self-replication is the primary goal. If we can make machines that make more machines, the system can grow organically.

Energy storage and water handling are integrated, as moving water uphill is one of the most effective ways to store energy in existence.  We aim to build and scale up a system of pumps, generators, valves, reservoirs, pipes, and water treatment which can be used together to handle a wide range of activities.  These include waste water treatment, energy storage, clean water production and supply, irrigation of crops, and water for other industrial manufacturing, such as medicine and textiles.

An examination of the history of industry shows that textile production is always of the utmost importance. Fashion is a very powerful cultural force.  If we take the definition of fundamentality taken above, fashion is a very fundamental technology, in that it is very personal, very close to our bodies and to how we exist on a day to day basis.  So one of the first elements we want to build into our edge factories is textile production entirely at the edge.  Edge textiles and edge fashion means the *whole* system is at the edge.  This starts with using only the waste streams in our environment, both raw materials like plastic bottles and finished materials like old discarded clothes. Then we build a culture of custom tailored making of clothes based on local fashion, local climate, local culture, and the desires of the local people.  We make clothes and distribute them for free to whoever needs them first, to create as much value as possible on the edge.

Perhaps of equal importance to the self-replicating machine shop factory is the self-replicating networked media machine.  Again, we must not be misled by the delusions of silicon valley in regards to what "self-replicating" means here.  We mean that with the help of skilled workers and some combination of materials we find around us that we can build a copy of a thing.  That thing must include the means to create documents, copy documents, and read documents.  It must also include systems to transmit documents both using signals like radio and optical and by physical movement of storage media.  All of this must be in a cycle, where we can make a thing, and then make more of it again with the broken parts of the old things. 


We want to focus not on making just a factory today that makes some things from trash.  We want to do whatever we can today to increase the long term chances for building the really big thing, the thing that totally replaces all mining and oil.  This is why we focus on building physics demonstrations, because it allows us to focus on fundamental elements, to have those elements be our first products, rather than immediately demanding products that scale globally overnight.  The rest of this paper will dive more specifically into what exactly we aim to build and how in order to make this distant dream of the truly edge-based factory a reality.

## 4. Self-Replicating Media

We aim to make all our technology self-replicating.  Language is perhaps the single most fundamental element of all technology.   Media is how we store and transmit language, making it perhaps the most powerful physical technology.  As stated above, our long term goal is total edge production of all media.  Eventually this will likely be hybrid technology which blends biological and more mineral technologies in new ways. 

There are many phases we must travel through in order to achieve our global goals.  Initially self-replicating media just means viral.  We create documents and share them online about how to make things.  We use the same methods everyone uses on social media to try to get these things to replicate.  This document is part of that effort, of course. Every reference, every link, ever tweet, every tiktok, all of these are attempts to make self-replicating media which replicate the physical things we make. 

From viral media content we move to our own media platforms, carried on Raspberry Pi's, which are documented below in the Pibrary section.  The Pibrary is just a system of freely distributed Raspberry Pi computers, shared as an extension of the library system, and run off of solar power out in public.  It also includes public-facing web pages hosted on commercial servers as well as web pages hosted with home Raspberry Pi's which use port forwarding to connect to the outside Internet.  This system hosts both simple Web 1.0 web pages consisting of a single static page, and the Pibrary book format which is a set of interlinked text documents which includes code to replicate the set, hosted on all the various servers mentioned here.  This platform represents a full stack of media, including audio, video, text, hardware, software, physical media, editing, creating, and sharing. We also build solar powered free mesh networks, just using off the shelf regular components.  Everything we build is shared freely with our community, and we pass it to whoever is the closest to the edge of the network, be it out in a park, on the street, or anywhere people the farthest out on the edges of the network exist. 

The next step out to the edge of the network of self-replicating media is to replace the Raspberry Pi and other hardware like it with Linux machines made from otherwise disposed of machines like old laptops, phones, tablets, routers and Internet of Things devices.  We will, as our network grows, develop a culture of finding old electronics as it becomes unusable under platforms like Windows, to get stable Linux installed, put the Pibrary software on, and integrate into our free network.  The bigger the network gets, the easier it will be to absorb more waste hardware, which will grow the network faster, and so on, creating an amplification of the growth of the Pibrary network.

As the networks expands and replicates, we will guide its evolution to get ever closer to the edge of the network, eventually eliminating all new waste materials and using completely organic technology.  Before we reach this final form of completely local production, we will build a sequence of technologies in our Edge Physics Electrical shop which allow more and more components of more broken things to be used.  We will develop a standardized breakout for screens to allow direct control of pixels in a simple way which can be directly programmed using Geometron.  We will develop a standard system of building up modular battery packs using any number of combined broken lithium ion polymer batteries. 

Ultimately if we are to have our media not need new microchips, we need to fabricate our own circuits, which we do using a full Geometron architecture as documented in the [Book of Geometron](http://trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/).

## The Edge Physics Network

The Edge Physics network is a social network of individuals who will together bring the ideas presented here into reality.  This is not a technological network or a piece of software or a "platform", nor is it a company or non profit.  This network crosses boundaries between small business, independent individuals, university faculty, governments, non profits, employees of large corporations, and any other entity who has something to contribute to this mission.  We are simply a network of people who exchange information, energy and materials to do things.  

The heart of what is proposed here is building this network.  This will involve building relationships between organizations, starting new programs in existing organizations and in some cases starting new organizations(both private and public).

 - sponsors
 - libraries
 - maker spaces
 - hacker spaces
 - social media influencers
 - university professors
