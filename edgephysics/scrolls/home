#  The Edge Physics Network

By Lafe Spietz

## 1. Introduction

The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web. The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the exact same materials to every corner of the globe. We can and should leverage the power of this uniform distribution of waste streams to totally eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by 2050.

The global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the edges of the network. We must create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy. We aim to build everything this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all. 

Building this new civilization is a long term project, in which progress will be measured in decades and centuries, not years.  In order to have the maximum impact on the long term trajectory of this process of transformation we focus on the most fundamental of all disciplines: physics.  We are creating a new way of doing physics in which all equipment is fabricated using waste stream materials, and all our work is geared toward building a universal system of knowledge on which we can base our new civilization.


## 2. What is Edge Physics? 

Physics is a search for the most fundamental laws of nature.  Between the seventeenth and mid twentieth centuries, the quest to use reductionist methods to always delve "deeper" into the structure of the Universe was incredibly fruitful.  We found that the products of this process had both an enormous impact on other sciences and on the technologies which have come to define our civilization.  We found that simple mathematical expressions could be used to both understand and control almost any element of the world we find around us.  This yielded both a fundamental world view which other sciences could build on and a tool kit which technology creators could use to build new things.  We dove deeply into the structure of the smallest things with atomic, nuclear and particle physics as well as the biggest things with astrophysics.  All through this process we continued to make progress on all fronts, benefiting humanity and our understanding of our world in a broad way.

And then, in the later half of the twentieth century, something started to change.  Increasingly, physics became a closed system.  We built bigger and bigger machines to probe what we claimed was "deeper and deeper" into the structure of the Universe.  But as we did this we departed more and more from the realm of reality we actually inhabit as humans.  As we entered the realm of what came to be known as "big science" we were promised that building bigger and bigger and more specialized experiments would give the same magnitude of results that earlier physics had. That is, that it would have a deep and broad impact on the rest of science and society.  This has proven not to be the case.  Big science has produced work which is useful to the rest of science in some limited capacity, but compared to things like quantum theory or atomic physics the contributions have been insignificant.  

Many people might dispute this claim, of course, and there are plenty of small examples of contributions from big science.  But to justify the claim made here we will define what it means for something to be "fundamental".  What made the physics from the earlier centuries fundamental was that it had a direct impact on other things greater than those things have on physics.  That is to say, a biologist needs to know about light and fluid flow more than a physicist needs to know about insect wings.  A chemist needs the quantum theory of electrons in a molecule more than a physicist needs to know everything about details of reaction rate calculations.  A mechanical engineer needs Newtons laws more than a physicist needs to know how to build an engine.  Loosely speaking, we can think of a space of bodies of knowledge, where there is a gradient of "fundamentality" which increases as a body has greater impact on other bodies.  

By this narrow definition, modern "pure" physics is remarkably non-fundamental.  The latest results about quarks, supersymmetry, dark matter and so on have zero impact on any other field even in physics, much less in the rest of science and technology or society at large.  Lord Kelvin famously stated that all science was either physics or "stamp collecting", and physicists in big science have joined the ranks of the stamp collectors in that they produce things that no one outside their field can even understand, much less make any use of.

At the same time that big science was taking over "pure physics", applied physics started to depart more and more from this type of physics, and a larger and larger fraction of physicists worked in industrial labs building new technologies using existing physics, such as the laser and the transistor.  This project of applying quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, and early particle physics to practical technology problems was also wildly successful and gave us much of the technology which now defines our society.  It was "fundamental" through the second half of the twentieth century in the same way that pure physics was in the prior age.   That is, things like the laser and transistor had impact on every other thing people do: science, technology, industry, and culture.  It changed the very structure of how we exist as a species on this planet.  

And yet applied physics is now suffering the same fate as pure physics for the same reasons.  We pushed too hard in one direction which had been productive in the past and lost sight of what it really means to be "fundamental".  The period of applied physics from the late twentieth century through the first two decades of the twenty first have seen a descent increasingly into fantasy worlds of an imagined future which we have been unable to deliver on.  From quantum computers to space elevators made of nanotubes, we have built the same social structures of rigid big science that exist in pure physics, with the same results.  We write papers that no one outside some very narrow field can understand, which have no impact on anyone else's work or on society at large.  

What we are proposing in this paper is a return of physics to its goal of creating a simple set of laws of the Universe which are as fundamental as possible.  However, what we propose is a more intentional definition of "fundamental".  We start from the assumption that the purpose of all science is ultimately to improve the human condition.  This can mean both technological means to improve the lives of all humans directly, but it can also mean creating a shared understanding which gives as many people as possible the satisfaction and power of being able to make sense of their world.  

Centering our cosmology on our own lives and the lives of the people and other living things around us, we now return to the goal physics has claimed but never delivered on: unification.  We aim now not to unify knowledge in some narrow sense of subatomic particles and black holes, but in the human-centered sense of everything we interact with as people.  We aim to create a unified way to exist in the world.  We claim unification to include a way of life, a way of thinking about life, and an approach to problem solving.  Our aim of unification in physics is to create the smallest possible set of skills and knowledge which has the largest possible impact on our ability to live better lives.  We set this as our aim and then conduct research to try to get closer to this ideal as we progress. 

Edge physics is physics both conducted at the edge of the global network and about the edge.  We use tools we can find right where we are, concepts we can share with the people directly around us, and study things we can directly observe around us.  The closer physics is to ourselves, and the more impact it has on our lives and the lives of people close to us the more fundamental it is.  The rest of this document is a proposal for how we will go about building this discipline and spreading it and growing it.  
 
## 3. Factories of the Future

As we build the basis of our system of knowledge, we must visualize the end product.  The product is the basic unit of our civilization, the means by which we produce technology in a post-extraction world.  This is the Edge Factory, the factory which produces all the artifacts we need for a good life using only the waste streams and energy found in in our immediate environment.  

What do we want from the factory of the future?  We want machines which do medicine, food production, creating comfortable habitats, media and networking, transportation, sanitation, textile production, and water processing.  And first and foremost we need machines which make machines.  This is the most fundamental machine technology.  

Machine self-replication has become something of a fantasy in the age of computers, where people imagine magical futuristic robots building themselves with total automation.  If we take a more realistic view of machine replication, machines have replicated themselves for all of human history.  Early human tools were stone and wood and bone tools used to make more stone and wood and bone tools.  The industrial revolution brought into being the machine shop factory, in which machines make machines, always with the help of skilled workers, and with a constant stream of fresh raw material.  Only with the latest waves of globalization has this model started to break down, where machines can only be created with the help of the vast globally interconnected web of systems.  

In order to break all the other links in the supply web, we must first build this fundamental building block of the edge machine shop and machine factory.  The edge machine shop is one of the core bridges that connect the physics program we are building today with the global factory system we are aiming to build.  We cannot fully envision what the end product will look like.  What we do now to get there is start with something we can figure out how to build at a smaller scale which has immediate value narrowly for edge physics, as will be discussed below.  

One of the other most fundamental technological elements we need our factories to build are those for manipulating fluids, such as pumps, valves, manifolds and so on.  We need to have a modular system for building biological reactors so that we can replicate all the products of modern medicine, which are generally produced using complex webs of production using e-coli.  The factories of the future will need to have some kind of large scale production of medicine of all kinds, but to get there what we aim to do as physicists is simply build tools to empower those in the life sciences to do what they already do but at the edges of the global network.  This means we need to build temperature and pressure control and a wide range of measurement technologies which can be used to extract information from living systems we use to make things.  We will work over the coming decades to build strong collaboration with those in the life sciences to keep building whatever tools they need to build more useful systems of living production, making better medicines in more efficient ways, as well as connecting this system to our food production and other types of product. As with all elements of our system, replication is a goal.  We want living systems which are backed up by information systems simple enough that we can understand them, manage them and most importantly replicate them, teaching others to copy the whole thing.  

The basic motive power for our machines will revert back to what it was before the rise of the global empires of petrochemicals: direct use of energy in the environment.  We will return to water wheels and windmills as direct drivers of machines which we use to make things.  But we also want to build a universal heat engine which we can run from concentrated solar heat energy as well as burning organic materials, geothermal, or any other source of heat we might find.  There might be many ways to do this, but initially we aim to build a technological system based on the Striling engine, a closed heat engine which compresses a working gas to convert a heat gradient to mechanical work.  One thing that is fantastic about these engines is that they can also be run backwards, operating as refrigerators and air conditioners as well as engines.  We aim to build a factory which has the minimum machines required to build Striling engines from trash which can run machines which can build more Stirling engines.  As in all our technology, self-replication is the primary goal. If we can make machines that make more machines, the system can grow organically.

Energy storage and water handling are integrated, as moving water uphill is one of the most effective ways to store energy in existence.  We aim to build and scale up a system of pumps, generators, valves, reservoirs, pipes, and water treatment which can be used together to handle a wide range of activities.  These include waste water treatment, energy storage, clean water production and supply, irrigation of crops, and water for other industrial manufacturing, such as medicine and textiles.  

An examination of the history of industry shows that textile production is always of the utmost importance. Fashion is a very powerful cultural force.  If we take the definition of fundamentality taken above, fashion is a very fundamental technology, in that it is very personal, very close to our bodies and to how we exist on a day to day basis.  So one of the first elements we want to build into our edge factories is textile production entirely at the edge.  Edge textiles and edge fashion means the *whole* system is at the edge.  This starts with using only the waste streams in our environment, both raw materials like plastic bottles and finished materials like old discarded clothes. Then we build a culture of custom tailored making of clothes based on local fashion, local climate, local culture, and the desires of the local people.  We make clothes and distribute them for free to whoever needs them first, to create as much value as possible on the edge.

Perhaps of equal importance to the self-replicating machine shop factory is the self-replicating networked media machine.  Again, we must not be misled by the delusions of silicon valley in regards to what "self-replicating" means here.  We mean that with the help of skilled workers and some combination of materials we find around us that we can build a copy of a thing.  That thing must include the means to create documents, copy documents, and read documents.  It must also include systems to transmit documents both using signals like radio and optical and by physical movement of storage media.  All of this must be in a cycle, where we can make a thing, and then make more of it again with the broken parts of the old things. 


We want to focus not on making just a factory today that makes some things from trash.  We want to do whatever we can today to increase the long term chances for building the fully articulated system, which totally replaces all mining and oil.  This is why we focus on building physics demonstrations, because it allows us to focus on fundamental elements, to have those elements be our first products, rather than immediately demanding products that scale globally overnight.  The rest of this paper will dive more specifically into what exactly we aim to build and how in order to make this distant dream of the truly edge-based factory a reality.

## 4. Self-Replicating Media

We aim to make all our technology self-replicating.  Language is perhaps the single most fundamental element of all technology.   Media is how we store and transmit language, making it perhaps the most powerful physical technology.  As stated above, our long term goal is total edge production of all media.  Eventually this will likely be hybrid technology which blends biological and more mineral technologies in new ways. 

There are many phases we must travel through in order to achieve our global goals.  Initially self-replicating media just means viral.  We create documents and share them online about how to make things.  We use the same methods everyone uses on social media to try to get these things to replicate.  This document is part of that effort, of course. Every reference, every link, ever tweet, every Tiktok, all of these are attempts to make self-replicating media which replicate the physical things we make. 

From viral media content we move to our own media platforms, carried on Raspberry Pi's, which are documented below in the Pibrary section.  The Pibrary is just a system of freely distributed Raspberry Pi computers, shared as an extension of the library system, and run off of solar power out in public.  It also includes public-facing web pages hosted on commercial servers as well as web pages hosted with home Raspberry Pi's which use port forwarding to connect to the outside Internet.  This system hosts both simple Web 1.0 web pages consisting of a single static page, and the Pibrary book format which is a set of interlinked text documents which includes code to replicate the set, hosted on all the various servers mentioned here.  This platform represents a full stack of media, including audio, video, text, hardware, software, physical media, editing, creating, and sharing. We also build solar powered free mesh networks, just using off the shelf regular components.  Everything we build is shared freely with our community, and we pass it to whoever is the closest to the edge of the network, be it out in a park, on the street, or anywhere people the farthest out on the edges of the network exist. 

The next step out to the edge of the network of self-replicating media is to replace the Raspberry Pi and other hardware like it with Linux machines made from otherwise disposed of machines like old laptops, phones, tablets, routers and Internet of Things devices.  We will, as our network grows, develop a culture of finding old electronics as it becomes unusable under platforms like Windows, to get stable Linux installed, put the Pibrary software on, and integrate into our free network.  The bigger the network gets, the easier it will be to absorb more waste hardware, which will grow the network faster, and so on, creating an amplification of the growth of the Pibrary network.

As the networks expands and replicates, we will guide its evolution to get ever closer to the edge of the network, eventually eliminating all new waste materials and using completely organic technology.  Before we reach this final form of completely local production, we will build a sequence of technologies in our Edge Physics Electrical shop which allow more and more components of more broken things to be used.  We will develop a standardized breakout for screens to allow direct control of pixels in a simple way which can be directly programmed using Geometron.  We will develop a standard system of building up modular battery packs using any number of combined broken lithium ion polymer batteries. 

Ultimately if we are to have our media not need new microchips, we need to fabricate our own circuits, which we do using a full Geometron architecture as documented in the [Book of Geometron](http://trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/).  

All of our physical media is intended to self-replicate as well.  Initially this is as simple as cardboard signs with magic marker which point to web addresses, and which people copy to spread the document at the address.  We also print into surfaces, such as clay, and use clay to print into plastic trash.  The other media describes how to make the robot out of trash which prints in the clay, and use the clay to print into trash.  

The purpose of all media we create is replication and evolution.  We always evolve the system to be more free, more edge-based, and more directed toward whatever the greatest community need is.  The primary documents on any media should always be about how to replicate that media, and are essentially advertisements to do that.  We create videos, write books, make web pages, write articles, tell stories and hold signs, all to get people to replicate the elements of our media. This is what makes it self-replicating media.  
 
## 5. The Pibrary

The Pibrary is an extension of the concept of the public library farther out to the outer edges of the network, using the Raspberry Pi open source computer.  We make solar power stations using easily purchased products to power Raspberry Pi terminals we share in public spaces with whoever needs access to the Internet.  The solar power station and terminal are used as a mutual aid resource, providing free network access and device charging to anyone we can find who is in need of help.  We provide Web 1.0 posting services for free to whoever we can help as well, posting links to anything people want promoted.  We can post pages and other documents for people, and then link to those resources with physical media in the form of cardboard signs made with magic markers. 

We ask people to donate Raspberry Pi hardware.  Each copy of the system has links to buy all the parts.  Ask people to buy parts and donate, and let the whole system grow into a whole network of free hardware.  We can also set up Raspberry Pi's in homes and businesses and open the port of the router there so that the Pi can be a server to the outside Internet.  To link to all this, we create physical media which connects to the domains which link to the servers, as mentioned in the previous section.  

Raspberry Pi's can also drive large screens or projectors in public spaces.  We try to find the most public space we can, and use physical media to link to web resources, as well as the physical sharing of our own media infrastructure(screens, printers, projectors).
 
Part of growing this network is to build, as a mutual aid project, free mesh networks in public spaces.  We find donors willing to share their bandwidth for free, and connect our mesh network to them.  Each hot spot or repeater on the network is powered by solar power and battery stations like the Raspberry Pi's.  Wherever there is the greatest need, that is where we will build the most infrastructure, until that is no longer longer that need.

The code is maintained by copying the [pibrary code repository on Github](https://github.com/LafeLabs/pibrary).  Each new instance copies all the code from there to your new repository and all your web resources and so on.  Further details on this system are in the Books of Geometron at [www.trashrobot.org](https://www.trashrobot.org).

## Geometron

Geometron is a way to control how machines work using geometry directly.  It is a way of thinking about geometry and language which is analogous to how computer science describes machines which manipulate numbers.  This combination of language, mathematics, philosophy and technology is documented at [www.trashrobot.org](https://www.trashrobot.org) in the Books of Geometron.  This collection of ideas and methods will be how we program the robots which build all of our technology.  Manufacturing, automation, and media are all things which can be described by sequences of geometric actions.  As Geometron is expanded along the lines described in the Books of Geometron, we will build a system in which numerical machines are entirely replaced by geometric machines. 

## The Edge Physics Machine Shop

A great machine shop is at the heart of any great physics department. The Edge Physics Network constitutes a physics department distributed across a wide network of people across faraway places.  We aim to find machinists who are willing to act as allies to our cause.  We try to make friends with every commercial machine shop, every trade school with a machinist training program, every academic machine shop, every high school shop teacher, every maker space, and every enthusiastic amateur with machine tools.  

Is that you? Are you a machinist or instructor in machining?  Join us! Become our shop! We want you to get all your materials for free from the trash, so all you need is tools and time and buy no raw materials.  To do this we must also be making friends with scrap metal buyers and sellers, junk yard people, junk haulers, surplus workers, and anyone else who works with scrap metal and machines.  

Are you a scrap metal person? Find machinists.  Find high school robotics teams and shop teachers.  Contact the local trade school and find machining teachers there.  Let us share our vision with each other: scrap metal, machines, and models to demonstrate our system.  

Our first goal in building this machine shop is to build models which demonstrate the most basic elements of our self-replicating trash machine system.  This means we must build a milling machine, a lathe, a drill press, a saw, all from trash.  This is your first task.  What is the minimum set of machines we can build which can build another set, all from trash?  Let's boil this down to the minimum, share our findings as we push toward that, and then build up from there to building more and more complex machines. 

Another model we want to build and share the details of how to replicate is the generator.  Many AC motors end up in waste streams, and they can be taken apart, modified with added magnets, and rewired to be generators converting rotation into DC electrical power charging batteries.  We want to build a modular system where an incoming waste stream is continuously converted into generators which we distribute to whoever can make the most use of them in our local community.  This should be adaptable to any kind of electrical pickup, be it water or wind.    We want to find as well waste-built systems for small scale water and wind, which we make and distribute, again as modular components, and always to whoever can make the most use of it.

All the electrical generators we build with the metal shop network are integrated into the technology developed by the Edge Physics electrical shop and the elements of the Pibrary network.  The generators can run media equipment, lights, robots, and most fundamentally machines to build more machines.  We want edge energy driving generators which create power to drive machines to build more machines, all in our local network of machine builders and scrappers.

We also aim to build a system of trash-based Stirling engines for direct sun-drive of machines. This starts with just simple little demonstrations, which can generate a few watts of electric power we use to charge USB devices directly from the sun.  From this model, we work to make it easier to copy from trash built parts, and share it over the Pibrary network described above.  We keep evolving the engines to be more powerful, easier to build, and easier to use.  We work with the robot developers on building automatic sun tracking technology to keep aimed at the sun through the course of a day.  These engines need to get integrated into the system described above of standardized electric generators.  This completes our basic set of edge energy: wind, sun and water.  We aim to build generators from a few watts to a few thousand watts.  Stirling engines must also be built for building refrigerators and air conditioners.  We aim to find the people who need air conditioning the most and deliver free solar powered air conditioners to them as mutual aid.  This can be done with sun-driven Striling engines driving another Stirling engine which extracts heat.  

This simple yet powerful set described here is the beginning.  It is enough to get free replication, if combined with the rest of the system.  Once it all starts to replicate and evolve, we build the next elements of the full system.  This means we build all of the most fundamental components of technology: pumps, compressors, valves, engines, agricultural machinery and so on.  As the shop network evolves, the linkages with the science network will also evolve, and we will build more complex production technologies.


## The Edge Physics Electrical Shop

The electrical shop is a critical partner with the machine shop. This is, like the machine shop, a social network of experts and organizations who collaborate to build models of the elements of edge physics.  We aim to share our vision with whoever we can find who handles electrical and electronic trash.  Electronics scrap dealers, recycling plant workers, electronics repair people, people who work at dumps, garbage and recycling pickup workers, and really anyone who might possibly have any interaction with electronic trash must all join our network!  We also need to build a network with electronics hobbyists like ham radio operators, makers, engineering students and artists.  

We build this social network using existing social media networks as well as the new ones we build and building around physical spaces where we can exchange physical things.  These are the same spaces we aim to link up using the Pibrary network.  The network of wireless hotspots, Rapsberry Pi media, and physical media spread the knowledge about how to make the electronics.  The electronics then supports this network.  Just as we aim for the machine shop to self-replicate by building more machines to make more machine shops, the electrical shop replicates by supporting the media hardware.  

We want to build a system of modular power cells from old broken lithium ion polymer batteries that retains the value of the elements in those.  How do we do this? Figure it out! Ask around! Someone must know and if they don't they can help us find someone who can.  We want modularity!  It should be easy for anyone to learn to do some simple transformation to take old broken batteries and turn them into something which can be incorporated into large battery packs. We are not looking for high energy density and portability, we are mostly just looking for something which we can keep using forever, even if it takes up a bunch of space in a static location.  That is our main goal: sustainability.  This power cell system must be part of a whole power handling system which includes being driven by the generators made by the machine shop, driving the machine shop, and powering all the media. 

In addition to electrical power, we want to get a system of modular interface directly to the pixels of a screen. We want to use this to build a way to directly drive pixels using Geometron as described in the [Book of Geometron](http://trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/).   We need to be able to have any screen be converted to a Raspberry Pi display and a Geometron screen.  As with the batteries, I don't know how to do this.  You have to find the right people and figure it out.  Ask around! Find the people really good at computer, phone and tablet repair and ask them to help.  Ask them to join us!  If they say it's impossible, find someone willing to ignore that and keep trying or find another choice for how to proceed with building all media from trash.  

We also need to replace the Raspberry Pi with something built from trash which has the same basic function: a generic free and open source Linux machine which can be used both to host, edit, and share media freely over a network.  We also need to replace the Arduino with something built from trash.  This should do the same basic thing of being a fully open platform which one can program over a standard USB cable using the Arduino IDE.  Eventually we want to replace that with something we program from scratch using Geometron, as with the Pi which will be replaced by full Geometron later.  

The Arduino is used to drive generic motor controllers which are used to build robots and other machines from trash.  This is the class of technologies which the DVD drive clay printer is just one example.  The Edge Physics Electrical shop network will build robots and distribute them to whoever seems to have the most need and or desire to replicate the system.  

Finally, in addition to whatever else might appear as we develop the system, we focus on building a technology for printing metal in electrolytes which we immerse circuit boards in using an electrode moved around with DVD drives and trash robot controllers.  This can be used to print connections between circuits found in trash, as well as to start building our own new technology for creating complex active electronics.  This will also be integrated with the biological technology we will be developing in collaboration between physics and the life sciences, so that we can eventually grow living electronics for all our media.

## The Edge Physics Network

The Edge Physics network is a social network of individuals who will together bring the ideas presented here into reality.  This is not a technological network or a piece of software or a "platform", nor is it a centralized company or non-profit.  This network crosses boundaries between small business, independent individuals, university faculty, governments, non-profits, employees of large corporations, and any other entity who has something to contribute to this mission.  We are simply a network of people who exchange information, energy and materials to do things.  

The heart of what is proposed here is building this network.  This will involve building relationships between organizations, starting new programs in existing organizations and in some cases starting new organizations(both private and public).  

I am promoting this network based on my personal and professional connections and the people I've found on social media spreading this message as Trash Robot.    I am dedicating my life to spreading this.  I will talk to anyone anywhere about anything which might help build this network.  I will write books, write articles, create and share social media, talk to people in person and distribute physical media for free.  I will take donations of hardware, build things people can use, and give them to whoever can use them.  

I can work for anyone who wants to support this process, and will move around to wherever there is energy to support the growth of the network. I  can work as a maker space educator, content creator, program architect, academic researcher, classroom teacher, subcontractor, or anything else which might fit in with the mission.  I will very enthusiastically promote anyone who supports the network.  If someone wants to sponsor, they can contact me and hire me and I'll promote their elements of the network and build the network out into whatever space they inhabit.  I can be Lafe Spietz the applied physicist, or [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org/) the creator of free media based on what is the most effective for spreading our network.

Read my documents. Share them. Copy them. Make them your own, and build out your own free network.  Let us all work together to build a new unified field of knowledge on which humanity can live freely!
