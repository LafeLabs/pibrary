#  Edge Physics

White Paper draft by Lafe Spietz

## 1. Introduction

The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web. The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the exact same materials to every corner of the globe. Our aim leverage the power of this uniform distribution of waste streams to totally eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by 2050.

We believe that the global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the edges of the network. We seek to create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy. We aim to build everything this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all. 

Building this new civilization is a long term project, in which progress will be measured in decades and centuries, not years.  In order to have the maximum impact on the long term trajectory of this process of transformation we focus on the most fundamental of all disciplines: physics.  We are creating a new way of doing physics in which all equipment is fabricated using waste stream materials, and all our work is geared toward building a universal system of knowledge on which we can base our new civilization.


## 2. What is Edge Physics? 

Physics is a search for the most fundamental laws of nature.  Between the seventeenth and mid twentieth centuries, the quest to use reductionist methods to always delve "deeper" into the structure of the Universe was incredibly fruitful.  We found that the products of this process had both an enormous impact on other sciences and on the technologies which have come to define our civilization.  We found that simple mathematical expressions could be used to both understand and control almost any element of the world we find around us.  This yielded both a fundamental world view which other sciences could build on and a tool kit which technology creators could use to build new things.  We dove deeply into the structure of the smallest things with atomic, nuclear and particle physics as well as the biggest things with astrophysics.  All through this process we continued to make progress on all fronts, benefiting humanity and our understanding of our world in a broad way.

And then, in the later half of the twentieth century, something started to change.  Increasingly, physics became a close system.  We built bigger and bigger machines to probe what we claimed was "deeper and deeper" into the structure of the Universe.  But as we did this we departed more and more from the realm of reality we actually inhabit as humans.  As we entered the realm of what came to be known as "big science" we were promised that building bigger and bigger and more specialized experiments would give the same results as earlier physics had. That is, that it would illuminate the rest of science and society.  This has proven not to be the case.  Big science has produced work which is useful to the rest of science in some limited capacity, but compared to things like quantum theory or atomic physics the contributions have been insignificant.  

Many people might dispute this claim, of course, and there are plenty of small examples of contributions from big science.  But to justify the claim made here we will define what it means for something to be "fundamental".  What made the physics from the earlier centuries fundamental was that it had a direct impact on other things greater than those things have on physics.  That is to say, a biologist needs to know about light and fluid flow more than a physicist needs to know about insect wings.  A chemist needs the quantum theory of electrons in a molecule more than a physicist needs to know everything about details of reaction rate calculations.  A mechanical engineer needs Newtons laws more than a physicist needs to know how to build an engine.  Loosely speaking, we can think of a space of bodies of knowledge, where there is a gradient of "fundamentalness" which increases as a body has greater impact on other bodies.  

By this narrow definition, modern "pure" physics is remarkably non-fundamental.  The latest results about quarks, supersymmetry, dark matter and so on have zero impact on any other field even in physics, much less in the rest of science and technology or society at large.  Lord Kelvin famously stated that all science was either physics or "stamp collecting", and physicists in big science have joined the ranks of the stamp collectors in that they produce things that no one outside their field can even understand, much less make any use of.

At the same time that big science was taking over "pure physics", applied physics started to depart more and more from this type of physics, and a larger and larger fraction of physicists worked in industrial labs building new technologies using existing physics, such as the laser and the transistor.  This project of applying quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, and early particle physics to practical technology problems was also wildly successful and gave us much of the technology which now defines our society.  It was "fundamental" through the second half of the twentieth century in the same way that pure physics was in the prior age.   That is, things like the laser and transistor had impact on every other thing people do: science, technology, industry, and culture.  It changed the very structure of how we exist as a species on this planet.  

And yet applied physics is now suffering the same fate as pure physics for the same reasons.  We pushed too hard in one direction which had been productive in the past and lost sight of what it really means to be "fundamental".  The period of applied physics from the late twentieth century through the first two decades of the twenty first have seen a descent increasingly into fantasy worlds of an imagined future which we have been unable to deliver on.  From quantum computers to space elevators made of nanotubes, we have built the same social structures of rigid big science that exist in pure physics, with the same results.  We write papers that no one outside some very narrow field can understand, which have no impact on anyone else's work or on society at large.  

What we are proposing in this paper is a return of physics to its goal of creating a simple set of laws of the Universe which are as fundamental as possible.  However, what we propose is a more intentional definition of "fundamental".  We start from the assumption that the purpose of all science is ultimately to improve the human condition.  This can mean both technological means to improve the lives of all humans directly, but it can also mean creating a shared understanding which gives as many people as possible the satisfaction and power of being able to make sense of their world.

## The Edge Physics Machine Shop

This and the electrical shop should just all be rolled into a maker space network, which is documented in the final section. Both of these should get rolled into the last section, making a total of 6 sections

 - scrap metal and recycling business
 - following an aluminum atom in recycling vs. in our machine shop
 - university, government and corporate surplus
 - automotive junk yards
 - household trash
 - tools of the shop
 - products of the shop
 - customers of the shop
 - who works in the shop and how

## The Edge Physics Electrical Shop

 - robotics and automation, generalized system for controlling all motorized things
 - modular general screen system


## The Edge Physics Network

The Edge Physics network is a social network of individuals who will together bring the ideas presented here into reality.  This is not a technological network or a piece of software or a "platform", nor is it a company or non profit.  This network crosses boundaries between small business, independent individuals, university faculty, governments, non profits, employees of large corporations, and any other entity who has something to contribute to this mission.  We are simply a network of people who exchange information, energy and materials to do things.  

The heart of what is proposed here is building this network.  This will involve building relationships between organizations, starting new programs in existing organizations and in some cases starting new organizations(both private and public).  

 - this is a network of people and institutions
 - sponsors
 - libraries
 - maker spaces
 - hacker spaces
 - social media influencers
 - universities
 - trade schools/tech schools
 - k-12 schools
 - scrap yards
 - factories
 - junk yards
 - tech companies
 - tribal governments
 - federal agencies
 - artists
 - traveling kids, truckers, people on the road
 - physicists
 - my little company which can be copied(pay my company to do stuff)
 - my job as an edge physicist which can also be copied(hire me)
 - my background, my elevator pitch to get this funded
 - but this is not just about me or this time or place. this is a direction, a star we can steer by all over the world for the next 100 years
