# Edge Physics
  
The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web.  The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the *exact same materials* to every corner of the globe.  The Internet has allowed knowledge to propagate from anywhere to anywhere instantly.  When we combine these two things, we have an opportunity unprecedented in human history to build a very technologically advanced civilization without any global supply chains at all.
