# edge economics
 
We are trying to push all industrial activity as far out to the edge of the global network as possible. This requires that we create new economic systems which can function and grow organically without central banking, government, or corporate structure.  

Money is a metaphor for mined material.  It reduces all value to a number: how many kilograms, how many kilowatt-hours and so on.  However, in a replication-based economic system, this metaphor breaks down.  Money is a medium of communication, of information exchange between parties representing trades of goods and services.  However in a replication based economic system, this number-based system becomes an opaque channel, hiding the more critical information of who, what, where, and why.  

In edge economics our primary goal is to promote replication.  This means that just as brands promote themselves with symbols and art and freely distributed media, we must behave the same way, and create an economic system based on this free replication of media.  This communicates much more information with less energy than money.  One little token with a symbol on it can tell someone to follow a tiktok account which promotes an event which trains people to build a thing, which they can replicate, expanding our reach and power.  

The machines described here in [edge robotics](scrolls/robotics) can be used to print physical media which can be exchanged to replicate brands, links, ideas, or any small pointer to information.  We create physical media which can be used to replicate, by pressing soft clay into hard clay and baking it, then repeating this to replicate.  

All of our media is a form of money-replacement, as all of it is used to try to replicate pointers to our other information which clones our science, technology and social structures which support them.  This also includes our cardboard signs at the most primitive level.  Cardboard signs cost almost nothing to make and have no monetary value, but replicate faster and more easily than just about any other form of physical media.  They already are widely used on the streets of the world to stimulate the sharing economy in the form of donations, rides, and other mutual aid.  We also include our system of textile based media to stimulate replication, which includes our open(no copyright, no trademarks) fashion brands.

This is a key shift from money!  Money is defined by its deliberate inhibition of replication.  This makes sense when currency represents a finite thing like a barrel of oil or a kilogram of salt.  However, when our economy is based on things which replicate freely, we need currency which can also replicate freely or it will not be able to accurately represent our systems.  

This dynamic is the source of our current rapid acceleration of inequality in the existing system.  Software, finance and media all create things which can be replicated an infinite number of times with essentially no added energy.  Furthermore, they benefit from network effects, where the more they replicate and grow the *more* they are worth to their users.  But the people building these systems are compensated for their labor using the same non-replicating monetary system as the people doing non-replicating labor in the old extraction/consumption system. Over time this leads to them getting essentially *all* of the money, which in a relative level impoverishes everyone who does not own the means of replication.  The only way out of this trap is to build replication systems which are both not inhibited by property(are released by their creators into the Public Domain) and are represented by a currency which itself replicates freely.  Part of what makes this a true edge economy is that we rely on physical media created from waste streams and commodity materials directly in our current locations, to be used physically again on location.  We print symbols into trash which we exchange to exchange information and spread our network, and then eventually that physical currency will be upcycled into finished products(unlike money which has no physical value anymore).  Again, unlike money where melting it down and using the metal to build things is generally illegal, we create our currency with the end goal of total absorption into our edge industries.  

Making standardized units like bottle caps into currency means our information economy is also a feedstock for our physical manufacturing economy.
