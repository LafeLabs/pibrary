# edge economics
 

We are trying to push all industrial activity as far out to the edge of the global network as possible. This requires that we create new economic systems which can function and grow organically without central banking, government, or corporate structure.  

Money is a metaphor for mined material.  It reduces all value to a number: how many kilograms, how many kilowatt-hours and so on.  However, in a replication-based economic system, this metaphor breaks down.  Money is a medium of communication, of information exchange between parties representing trades of goods and services.  However in a replication based economic system, this number-based system becomes an opaque channel, hiding the more critical information of who, what, where, and why.  

In edge economics our primary goal is to promote replication.  This means that just as brands promote themselves with symbols and art and freely distributed media, we must behave the same way, and create an economic system based on this free replication of media.  This communicates much more information with less energy than money.  One little token with a symbol on it can tell someone to follow a tiktok account which promotes an event which trains people to build a thing, which they can replicate, expanding our reach and power.
