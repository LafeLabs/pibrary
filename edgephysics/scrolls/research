# research
 
Research means we build demonstrations and build curriculum around them which teaches people who are impacted by the Digital Divide technical skills to directly benefit their communities. We fight the brain drain, build in place.

 - build, document, and spread the fully upcycled DVD  drive as generic science and technology platform(spin, move stepper, control drawer, fine motion control, laser(s), detector(s), optics, material reuse
 - build an open source stirling engine from trash, spread it, build curriculum around it, use for both a small solar engine and a cooler(start small, and simple) 
 - develop an arduino replacement using a readily available microcontroller found in trash
 - develop and maintain a *nix fork to get a stripped down web server running on the maximum hardware, possibly just open WRT extensions, which can also run a web browser and be  a web client with a generic display output 
 - develop a standard modular wiring breakout from ALL pixel devices to our generic raspberry pi like computers as well as raspberry pi
 - build electric generators for wind and water and sun engine driven power using old AC motors converted with magnets
 - use the trash robot probe and electric currents/voltages on an electrode in solution to deposit metal slowly in three dimensions as a generic interconnect technology
 - develop a modular batter cell technology for stationary power stations with low energy density and total ability to incorporate all battery types after they are "dead"
 - develop the software and hardware to create mesh networks from hacked old routers and iot devices, build a program to collect, convert and deploy them
