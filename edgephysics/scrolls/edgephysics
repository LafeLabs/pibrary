# edgephysics
 
 - the more universal something is the more fundamental it is: water is more fundamental than something you can only see at CERN
 - we build all our instruments using what is in our immediate environment
 - we only build what we can directly share with people in our community(school teachers, college students, amateur scientists, science researchers, local people interested in science)
 - we work to build *all* the tools of science using our methods from applied physics(pumps, valves, vacuum, imaging, engines, electronics, media)

Full edge physics is when we have an understanding of our immediate physical environment based on knowledge we can teach to people locally and things we can measure locally using machines we build here.  

Our research program consists of building the local network which puts all this together, including the scrap yards, junk yards, surplus facilities, waste managment companies and so on, then the shops to build things and labs to develop things and finally to actual people who will use them.  We document this system using the free and open source books documented in the [edge library](scrolls/library) on the [edge network](scrolls/network), so that the whole thing can freely replicate from one local edge to another.  

The book will delve into how this method can lead us back to the "fundamental" physical investigations which are now called "pure physics".  Atomic and nuclear measurements, and small scale(MeV) particle acceleration can be used as probes which dive into the deep structure of reality while remaining tethered to the machines we actually use rather than machines which exist in one location in the world.  If you can't replicate it anywhere and everywhere it's not really science, that is our baseline criterion for all work, but it can be used to build back a deep structural field of physics.  

We also need to have open source platforms on which to carry all this out with modern information technology.  This is all based on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, like every other element of the system presented here.  The Arduino can control experiments and record data.  The Raspberry Pi can be used to document everything we do, share it, access the Internet, control experiments from the network, program the Arduino and be a platform for general calculation.  We center all physics measurement and calculations on computers around the combination of Python and Latex which can be made with the Jupyter notebook system.  

The project being proposed here will produce curriculum in all of the elements of applied physics education, all of which involves directly building useful science instruments from waste streams locally.  Our tools are waste streams in our community, open source platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, the Geometron system, Jupyter, and social media.  We produce physics demonstrations which teach every element of physics described in the previous chapter(these chapters probably will get combined).  The curriculum self-replicates as we build instruments which are used by other people learning edge physics across the world. 

Strategically, it makes sense for this document to not oppose existing physics.  It has no bearing on our work.  We do not compete for funding. We do not compete to get into the elite research journals.  We do not compete for YouTube views.  We are simply in a different business. It is the goal of this book to document a new kind of physics, and to leave existing physics alone!
