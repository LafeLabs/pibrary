Manufacturing at the Edge of the global supply web is based on using universally available waste streams, local energy, local labor, and producing for local consumption using the global network of information to propagate the constructions.

We will build simple machines from waste materials which are used to process waste materials into finished products.  This can be a combination of free resource of useful things for the community and commercial products which can be sold to directly fund our work.  Our initial products are science tools directly geared toward simply *demonstrating* all of our physical principles: thermodynamics, optics, electromagnetism, gravity, classical and quantum mechanics,  mathematical methods.  We move from science instruments to all the tools to replicate our system: the electrical and machine shops.  From there we build machines to build other products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals, all of which we incorporate into our factory to build on site.  

Again, this needs the big roadmap for the next 50 years, how the electrical shop, mechanical shop, media system and edge physics curriculum can be a basis for all of the agents of replication.  Detail all the basic parts: water purification, organic waste disposal, food production, housing construction, HVAC, refrigeration, pharmas, etc.  This is a fully edge-based industrial system we are planning within 25-50 years.
