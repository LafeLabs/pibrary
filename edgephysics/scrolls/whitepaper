#  Edge Physics

White Paper by Lafe Spietz, same as the book, but written before the book.  This should be about 5000 words or so maybe.

## Introduction

The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web. The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the exact same materials to every corner of the globe. Our aim leverage the power of this uniform distribution of waste streams to totally eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by 2050.

We believe that the global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the edges of the network. We seek to create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy. We aim to build everything this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all. 

Building this new civilization is a long term project, in which progress will be measured in decades and centuries, not years.  In order to have the maximum impact on the long term trajectory of this process of transformation we focus on the most fundamental of all disciplines: physics.  We are redefining the structure of physics toward a new physics in which all equipment is fabricated using waste stream materials, and all our work is geared toward building a universal system of knowledge on which we can base our new civilization.

## Edge Physics

 - definition of fundamental
 - values: life first
 - definition of physics
 - elements of physics
 - curriculum
 - recapturing "pure" physics of today in the Edge Physics of tomorrow 
 - tools and methods: arduino, raspberry pi, math, free open documents, jupyter, applied math
 - product: media for replication of experiments which demonstrate principles, serve as seeds of the full system of Edge Civilization

## The Edge Physics Machine Shop

 - scrap metal and recycling business
 - following an aluminum atom in recycling vs. in our machine shop
 - university, government and corporate surplus
 - automotive junk yards
 - household trash
 - tools of the shop
 - products of the shop
 - customers of the shop
 - who works in the shop and how

## The Edge Physics Electrical Shop

 - tools and methods: build modular units of trash elements
 - DVD drives as an example of a start and of an ongoing program
 - electrical waste stream generators: surplus and scrap
 - robotics and automation, generalized system for controlling all motorized things
 - modular general screen system
 
## The Edge Factory

 - ultimate goal of all our work, self-supporting
 - energy
 - pharma
 - electronics
 - mechanical
 - media
 - hvac
 - water

## The Edge Library
 
 - Raspberry pi
 - mesh networks
 - off grid hardware
 - self-replicating documents system(the code which edits the document itself replicates)
 - web pages
 - github

## Media

 - Geometron: robot control, screen control, layout, symbol construction, all design in the future, all graphics
 - social media content
 - social media distribution
 - web pages
 - future full stack trash based media system with power cells, screens, geometron processors

## The Edge Network

 - this is a network of people and institutions
 - sponsors
 - libraries
 - universities
 - k-12 schools
 - scrap yards
 - factories
 - junk yards
 - tech companies
 - tribal governments
 - federal agencies
 - artists
 - traveling kids, truckers, people on the road
 - physicists
 - my little company which can be copied(pay my company to do stuff)
 - my job as an edge physicist which can also be copied(hire me)
 - my background, my elevator pitch to get this funded

## The Network

 - the timely message of pandemic and climate change and central network flaws
 - the global machine of endless extraction
 - free manufactured products in waste streams everywhere
 - The Internet as a protocol and set of technologies independent of the owners of it in its current form
 - how big tech extracts wealth from everyone as network landlords

## Moving to the Edge

 - The idea of the edge
 - The power of the edge, the unique time in history for doing this
 - our goal: abolish oil, gas, and mining by 2050
 - Edge power
 - Edge manufacturing

## Edge Manufacturing
  
 - The potentiality based on what is available, survey of waste streams
 - the sun/trash cycle vs. the coal/steel cycle
 - textiles, their historical role in industrial development and also in our system
 - media and networking hardware
 - engines: heat, water, wind
 - self-replicating machine shop
 - pharmaceuticals 
 - robotics and automation

## The Edge Network

 - How edge networks replace big tech, economics of facebook vs. local web pages
 - Free mesh networks sponsored by community and run by our little company
 - Solar stations for the pi's and mesh network hardware
 - free Internet connections for the mesh network paid for by local operating company
 - Raspberry Pi Pibrary as repository of books which document things
 - The Street Book, book of commerce
 - Chaos Game
 - The Factory Book
 - Local repository of knowledge, books about here
 - the role of physical media: signs, tokens, 

## Edge Funding

- This is a self-replicating business plan, everything is Public Domain and can be copied
 - We provide everything for free in whatever way will create the most benefit to whoever needs it most and who we can most help with our network, and based on what we are best at doing
 - We raise money from *sponsors* who support this mission based on the needs of those we help

## Edge Physics

 - Why physics?
 - Physics of trash
 - physics from trash
 - direct community support
 - demonstrations of all elements of edge industry
 - specific proposals
 - free media 
 - free books, library creation

## Trash Robot

 - Lafe Spietz brief professional biography including all published works
 - Lafelabs LLC is a one person LLC dedicated to creating Public Domain educational materials and distributing them via edge networks as described in this white paper
 - Trash Robot, a dba for Lafelabs, an open brand, a set of things to replicate, can involve other people and organizations, but is operated as lafelabs
 - Geometron
 - The things Trash Robot is making
 - Edge Physics, the Book and then the Library
 - This whole thing can be replicated by other people in other places to help other people with other things using other companies and other business models
 - Not an ISP.  The network is a private network which exists for the sole purpose of distributing books on the edge network, connections are always in public
 - clay tokens as self-replicating currency
 - self-replicating robots which print the tokens
 - self-replicating crafts and fashion
 - looking for jobs and sponsors
 - looking for collaborators
