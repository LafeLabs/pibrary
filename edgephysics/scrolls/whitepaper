#  The Edge Revolution

White Paper by Lafe Spietz

## The Network

 - the timely message of pandemic and climate change and central network flaws
 - the global machine of endless extraction
 - free manufactured products in waste streams everywhere
 - The Internet as a protocol and set of technologies independent of the owners of it in its current form
 - how big tech extracts wealth from everyone as network landlords

## Moving to the Edge

 - The idea of the edge
 - The power of the edge, the unique time in history for doing this
 - our goal: abolish oil, gas, and mining by 2050
 - Edge power
 - Edge manufacturing

## Edge Manufacturing
  
 - The potentiality based on what is available, survey of waste streams
 - the sun/trash cycle vs. the coal/steel cycle
 - textiles, their historical role in industrial development and also in our system
 - media and networking hardware
 - engines: heat, water, wind
 - self-replicating machine shop
 - pharmaceuticals 
 - robotics and automation

## The Edge Network

 - How edge networks replace big tech, economics of facebook vs. local web pages
 - Free mesh networks sponsored by community and run by our little company
 - Solar stations for the pi's and mesh network hardware
 - free Internet connections for the mesh network paid for by local operating company
 - Raspberry Pi Pibrary as repository of books which document things
 - The Street Book, book of commerce
 - Chaos Game
 - The Factory Book
 - Local repository of knowledge, books about here
 - the role of physical media: signs, tokens, 

## Edge Funding

- This is a self-replicating business plan, everything is Public Domain and can be copied
 - We provide everything for free in whatever way will create the most benefit to whoever needs it most and who we can most help with our network, and based on what we are best at doing
 - We raise money from *sponsors* who support this mission based on the needs of those we help

## Edge Physics

 - Why physics?
 - Physics of trash
 - physics from trash
 - direct community support
 - demonstrations of all elements of edge industry
 - specific proposals
 - free media 
 - free books, library creation

## Trash Robot

 - Lafe Spietz brief professional biography including all published works
 - Lafelabs LLC is a one person LLC dedicated to creating Public Domain educational materials and distributing them via edge networks as described in this white paper
 - Trash Robot, a dba for Lafelabs, an open brand, a set of things to replicate, can involve other people and organizations, but is operated as lafelabs
 - Geometron
 - The things Trash Robot is making
 - Edge Physics, the Book and then the Library
 - This whole thing can be replicated by other people in other places to help other people with other things using other companies and other business models
 - Not an ISP.  The network is a private network which exists for the sole purpose of distributing books on the edge network, connections are always in public
 - clay tokens as self-replicating currency
 - self-replicating robots which print the tokens
 - self-replicating crafts and fashion
 - looking for jobs and sponsors
 - looking for collaborators
