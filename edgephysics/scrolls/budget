# Budget Proposal
 
 - media crew: camera, sound, light, setup, scripting, editing, production, social media promotion(150k/yr)
 - undergrad and high school students paid internships to build things(150k/yr, part time)
 - money to build free public mesh networks(150k/yr)
 - money for travel into communities to set up for  a few weeks, build and train(150k/yr)
 - my salary as a soft money faculty or as ceo of my company(150k/yr, market value salary to be a viable position where I can be replaced)
 - space rental, insurance, general overhead(150k/yr)
 - miscellaneous machine tools(100k)

150k x 6 = about 900k/yr, round up to 1 million/year for first three years to build out a network and transition to local edge funding streams

We aim to raise 5 million dollars for a three year program to support building this out as partnership between various University departments and community stake holders.  We round up to 5 million to support university overhead if this all goes through a university.  If it is done purely in the private sector, the budget can be much lower, maybe 1 million dollars for the first three years.

We are looking for sponsors for this work from government, non profits, high net worth individuals, tech companies, and anyone who shares the vision presented here.  If enough people support the vision, crowd funding could be possible.  If we can find a million small donors just a few dollars each would fund us.  One visionary with money could also fund it with a single check.  

We are also looking for host institutions which will support this work by taking in the grant money, hiring me and a staff, providing space, and allowing us to set up our social network on campus.  This can have huge benefit to campuses, reducing waste, providing original research publications, and bringing in streams of grant money.  

The deliverables consist of media we release into the Public Domain, as well as installed networks in marginalized communities who are currently affected by inequities in access to information networks.  While this work will lead to many for profit ventures, the project being funded here is educational: we train people directly and then create media as we go for the rest of the world to copy.  

It is important that we do both.  Without globally shared free media, our system will not replicate.  But without going into physical communities and building things that work, it will not be proven to be viable.
