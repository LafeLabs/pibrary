# The Machine Shop
 
We aim to build machines constructed only from things directly around us, used locally and to produce things which are themselves used locally.  Every good physics department has a good machine shop.  Ultimately we aim to use the machine shop to develop plans to build machines in house with metal waste streams which can replicate the whole shop.  We will wind motor coils, machine shafts threads, structures, fasteners and so on as needed to make a whole set of machines such as milling machines, lathes, welders--everything.  

We use this shop to build all the metal parts of science equipment of all kinds: plumbing, enclosures, fixtures to hold things in place, and so on.

Finally a primary research goal of this shop is to build the engines which will allow us to have edge-generated energy.  That is the most locally generated energy we can possibly have, which is direct solar heat engines, direct geothermal or organic heat engines, water engines, and wind engines.  All of these are simple mechanical devices which are appropriate to fabricate in a machine shop made from trash.
