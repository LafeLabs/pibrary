# introduction
 

The global pandemic and accelerating climate crisis have shown the fragility of our centralized oil-driven global supply web.  The last 300 years of exponentially increasing extraction and globalized manufacturing have distributed the *exact same materials* to every corner of the globe.  Our aim leverage the power of this uniform distribution of waste streams to totally eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by 2050.

We believe that the global supply web can be made more resilient against every potential threat in the future by moving out to the *edges* of the network.  We seek to create a whole new civilization this way, building all elements of manufacturing from local waste streams and powered from local small-scale renewable energy.  We aim to build *everything* this way: media, biotechnology, manufacturing, industrial automation, heating and cooling, everything we need to live a very high standard of living, but without any global supply web at all.  

This plan will enable us to completely eliminate all oil, gas, and mining by the year 2050.  We will build will our infrastructure at the level of small local communities, but replicate it freely across the whole world.   We will fund this also at the local level, forming our networks inside existing institutions at the local level, and providing value which will be locally compensated.  

These activities, taken together, constitute a movement towards the edges of the network which makes up our civilization.  The project proposed here consists of building a program in "edge physics", or physics of materials we find everywhere in the modern age in waste streams(cars, smart phones, old clothes, food trash, plastic packaging, scrap metal).  We both build things *from* these waste streams and build things to study them, creating a whole discipline of physics centered on the world directly around us as it exists today.
