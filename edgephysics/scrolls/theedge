# What is the edge?

 - The world is a network.  
 - This network is global and very centralized in power
 - Too much power is in the hands of too few.  
 - Too many choke points in global network make it fragile, unstable
 - all based on extraction, empires needed for extraction, extraction needed for empires, the WHOLE network is needed for every product, every service, everything
 - Size of network makes it totally out of any control by anyone, we have no agency at any level
 - The edge of the network for the purposes of this work is our physical locality
 - We believe networks can be made more resilient, more responsive, and more humane by moving more energy and attention out to the edges of the Global Network
 - Things we want to move to the Edge include: science, economics, manufacturing, learning and teaching, energy, medicine, construction, culture, and media 
 - Edge transition means breaking up large things into large numbers of small things
