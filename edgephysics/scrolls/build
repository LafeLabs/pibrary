# Infrastructure Build

## Power

 - wind nanopower, < 20 watts trash based wind generator for charging small batteries
 - water nanopower, < 20 watts trash based water generator, high speed but small quantity of water and force, also oscillator with a log in a deeper river
 - water power using a bicycle with a drive of the pedals and a pickup motor on the wheel to charge larger battery banks
 - larger water generators, using washing machine parts, 500-2000 watts( a few hp)
 - larger wind generators, using scaled down blades of standard wind farms, 3-8 feet across, a few hundred watts
 - emergency-only wind generator kites, fly in extreme storm winds, very small area, very high speed, high force, high throughput, a few hundred watts a foot or so across
 - power stations with batteries to drive network infrastructure
 - power stations which produce hydrogen and oxygen for use in industrial, medical, welding, airships, clean water, and power
 - hydrogen internal combustion engines
 - hydrogen-burn stirling engines
 - hydrogen-burn steam engines
 - hydrogen fuel cells
 - network to produce and distribute free biodiesel using food waste grease
