# measurement
 
We need to both use the materials in our environment to build our measurement tools, and need to turn those tools on those materials to learn more about them.  An example of this is building x-ray machines to determine what alloy of waste metal we are dealing with using waste streams of science, industrial and medical electronics.

We are not going to rely on central manufacturing for any measurement tool. This involves building a whole new science of measurement from the ground up around electronic waste streams and what is easy to use from them.

The BIPM is now the Bartertown Institute of Practical Metrology.

 - Oscilloscopes made from trash, the trash scope
 - x ray machines, spectrometers for materials characterization
 - wifi measurement tools
 - curriculum built around all the available measurement tools from Adafruit with Arduino and Raspberry Pi
