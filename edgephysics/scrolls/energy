# energy
 
We need motive power of some kind for all industry. We seek to generate that energy as close as possible to where the work is done.  This is a return to an older way of doing industry, what was used in water mills in the very early days of the industrial revolution.

 - solar powered stirling engines
 - trash and biofuel fire powered stirling engines
 - hydro and wind power at very small scales(<100kw)
 - modular trash based systems, what waste streams to use
 - specifically automotive trash stream as source
 - heliostat technology at scale, with many people building robots which source the mirror controllers


This section needs a detailed breakdown of the physics and economics compared between our system of large numbers of small solar engines vs. the huge system in California which is a many dollars per watt boondoggle.
