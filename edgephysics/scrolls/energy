# energy
 
We need motive power of some kind for all industry. We seek to generate that energy as close as possible to where the work is done.  This is a return to an older way of doing industry, what was used in water mills in the very early days of the industrial revolution.

 - solar powered stirling engines
 - trash and biofuel fire powered stirling engines
 - hydro and wind power at very small scales(<100kw)
 - modular trash based systems, what waste streams to use
 - specifically automotive trash stream as source
 - heliostat technology at scale, with many people building robots which source the mirror controllers


This section needs a detailed breakdown of the physics and economics compared between our system of large numbers of small solar engines vs. the huge system in California which is a many dollars per watt boondoggle.


We also want an energy budget for aluminum from mined ore, aluminum in current recycling and aluminum directly used on site.  The biggest source of energy in the future is from not doing things that benefit no one.  We do not need to drive around in circles and set things on fire all day.  How much energy do we actually need for a good life?  Basic thermodynamics of the human body being cool/warm, medicine and food production, media hardware power, and nothing more.  Living within our means in *local* energy.
