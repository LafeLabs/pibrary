## Minimal Cybermagic Set

This is the bare minimum collection of files which can self-replicate via the web browser over a network when the Geometron software is installed.  The replicator program is [replicator.php](replicator.php).  

The dna.txt is as follows:

```
{
    "html": [
        "index.html"
    ],
    "data": [
        "dna.txt"
    ],
    "php": [
        "dnagenerator.txt",
        "editor.txt",
        "fileloader.txt",
        "filesaver.txt",
        "replicator.txt",
        "text2php.txt"
    ]
}
```
