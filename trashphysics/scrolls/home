# Trash [Physics](scrolls/whatisphysics)

Trash Physics uses the fundamental forces of the universe to create all things for free from the living Earth, locally to wherever we are.

We center physics on the living physical world in our immediate environment. This consists of the energy from the sun and the Earth, the flow of water through our environment, air, soil, living things, and the existing trash of the old civilization we are surrounded by.  Trash physics uses the tools of physics to address how to build a new civilization from the trash of the old, which is based on self-replicating methods by which we transform trash into usable products locally.  

We take the most fundamental thing in our Universe to be the living Earth of which we are a part. We use the traditional tools of physics to build the basis of industry from trash and the living world which can support the rest of society.

The elements of our world as trash physicists are:

 - the sun: its spectrum, its thermodynamics, how the Earth's orbit affects seasons
 - the moon: tides, cycles, orbit, the moon landings,  politics of the moon
 - the earth: size, shape, lat/lons, thermodynamics, structure, rocks
 - the water cycle: sea, vapor/clouds, rain, rivers, streams, lakes, ground water, ice and snow
 - air: wind energy, vacuum pumps, air pressure, nuclear weapons shockwaves, sound waves, content, other gasses(nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, neon,CO2,CO, other rare gasses, ozone, plasma) clouds, lightning
 - flowing ions, chemistry, solutions, transformation. chemical potential and molecular/atomic transport
 - physics of plants, fungi, micro organisms
 - how energy flows through living things: sun, chemical energy, mechanical energy
 - trees, wood, organic materials for mechanical structures
 - electromagnetic radiation: visible light, radio, low frequency fields, radioactivity, x rays, infrared, UV, photosynthesis

Elements of the world we are building with trash physics

 - textile mills
 - machine shops
 - display screens
 - human/machine interface: keyboards, pointers, voice, sound, motion sensor, touch sensor
 - environmental sensors
 - automation control: geometron robots
 - document editing, storage, replication
 - magic: the things we build which are self-replicating
