# Trash [Physics](scrolls/whatisphysics)

Trash Physics uses the fundamental forces of the universe to create all things for free from the living Earth, locally to wherever we are.  

We center physics on the living physical world in our immediate environment. This consists of the energy from the sun and the Earth, the flow of water through our environment, air, soil, living things, and the existing trash of the old civilization we are surrounded by.  Trash physics uses the tools of physics to address how to build a new civilization from the trash of the old, which is based on self-replicating methods by which we transform trash into usable products locally.  

We take the most fundamental thing in our Universe to be the living Earth of which we are a part. We use the traditional tools of physics to build the basis of industry from trash and the living world which can support the rest of society.

In Trash Physics we learn how our world works using the traditions of physics, and then directly apply that specific understanding of the world to building factories which produce mechanical machines built from trash to replicate the factory.  We also build textile mills which produce clothes we give away for free.  We also build engines to drive all other machines.  

Trash Physics is built on top of the Pibrary.  The Pibrary is free media in that it is without property or money.  It still is all based on extraction. But it is given out for free to those who currently have the least and are in public spaces(no property).  The Pibrary should create breathing room for people who live off of operating that network and spreading it.  Pibrary can support the world of building the Trash Physics and Trash Factory libraries.  

**The elements of our universe as trash physicists are:**

 - the sun: its spectrum, its thermodynamics, how the Earth's orbit affects seasons
 - the moon: tides, cycles, orbit, the moon landings,  politics of the moon
 - the earth: size, shape, lat/lons, thermodynamics, structure, rocks
 - the water cycle: sea, vapor/clouds, rain, rivers, streams, lakes, ground water, ice and snow
 - air: wind energy, vacuum pumps, air pressure, nuclear weapons shockwaves, sound waves, content, other gasses(nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, neon,CO2,CO, other rare gasses, ozone, plasma) clouds, lightning
 - heat physics: fire, heat engines, steam, hot air
 - flowing ions, chemistry, solutions, transformation. chemical potential and molecular/atomic transport
 - how energy flows through living things: sun, chemical energy, mechanical energy
 - machine physics: force, power, torque, energy of shafts, motors, rotors, ropes, pulleys, wheels
 - electromagnetic radiation: visible light, radio, low frequency fields, radioactivity, x rays, infrared, UV, photosynthesis
 - force, fields
 

**Elements of the new industrial production system we are building with trash physics:**

 - geometron: the language and system
 - the pibrary(includes free wireless ineternet, free raspberry pi, free solar, free books)
 - solar energy concentrators to drive heat engines
 - heat engines to drive machines and pump heat(AC/refrigeration)
 - water engines(river, wave, tide mechanics) for drive of machines
 - windmills for drive of machines
 - the machines for all elements of textile production
 - machine shops(metal, wood) which build all the other machines
 - generic tube/valve/reservoir/pump system for fluids and gasses to deliver to chem and bio people
 - display screens(upcycle screens for generic direct pixel control via Geometron)
 - growing electrical interconnects in solution
 - foundry, melt metal into ingots
 - human/machine interface: keyboards, pointers, voice, sound, motion sensor, touch sensor
 - environmental sensors to monitor the whole living world, weather, water
 - automation control: geometron robots for fabrication, agricultural automation
 - wireless network infrastructure
 - geometron processors to control screens directly for display of documents using hybrid fabrication with existing
 - electrical storage cells
 - all the tools of the machine shop: milling machine, lathe, drill press, sheet metal brake, geometron-based CNC all which can run off a heat engine, water engine or wind engine
 - plastics molding and welding machines for making products directly from plastic trash
 - heat engines to drive machines with the sun, geothermal energy, biomass energy or a fire
 - water engines which drive machines with rivers, tides and waves
 - windmill technology, again with direct drive
 - battery packs using material which can all be re-used
 - sewing machines
 - knitting machines
 - textile looms
 - spinner and drawer which convert plastic bottles to thread
 - screens with modular interface to just set an arbitrary pixel
 - geometron machines which store and display documents on screens
 - automation robots for agricultural use
 - air conditioners and refrigerators
