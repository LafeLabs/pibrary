# Trash Physics

## By [Trash Robot(tiktok)](https://www.tiktok.com/@trash_robot), AKA Lafe Spietz

I have been involved in applied physics research and technology development for the last 25 years.  I have worked for big government, private and public universities, as a freelancer, as founder of my own startups, with large blue chip companies, and with non profit defense contractors.  

After working in all these spaces I have concluded that something is deeply wrong with the structure of the whole endeavor I have dedicated my life to.  It's not any one institution that is broken, it's that I now view our whole civilization as being stuck on a very harmful path.  

Our whole society consists of a destructive process of consuming and destroying resources.  In order to maintain this process, hard power needs to be projected over large distances and large populations must be tightly controlled through centralized domination.  Physics is and always has been an integral part of this, being central to both the destructive means of production of our current industrial system and central to the weapons systems used to enforce that system.  

At the same time, physics has also been central to the dominant world view over the last few hundred years as the current industrial system has risen to power.  

This book is being written to tell my story of how I got here, to tell all the things I see as most fundamental to what is wrong with physics, and finally to launch a new kind of physics, Trash Physics, which is directly supported materially the community it serves, and which is always focused on giving back to that supportive community.  

This book will be released for free via the "pibrary", a system of self-replicating documents shared using the Raspberry Pi free open source computing platform.  With your support I will be able to both work full time on creating this book and sharing it freely online, but will be able to expand the system of free network based library resources which support it.  Supporters can use the free system to promote their own self-replicating document sets to promote whatever they are doing.  

This is how this project will give back to supporters, by building media which promotes whatever you want to promote.  The Patreon will have ways for you to donate to support the project, to direct what self-replicating documents I create and share, and to collaborate with other community members to make user-generated books which become part of the library.
