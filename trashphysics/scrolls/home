## [up to library](../)

Really three books: memoir, book about why physics is broken, and book about what a unified physics would be.  Each could be about 100 pages, for a total of about 300 pages, so one printed volume but three web books.

Broken Physics 

 - novelty for the sake of novelty
 - doing science by, about and for machines
 - why we can't do things that need to be done: composting toilets, solar power etc
 - doing exactly what you did last year
 - doing what your advisor did
 - doing the fad
 - startups
 - corporate/industrial R&D
 - APL
 - quantum computing specifically
 - carbon nanotechnology specifically
 - the delusions of silicon valley
 - the delusions of those who follow silicon valley blindly
 - mathematical fantasies
 - why reductionism fails to give useful results

WORK IN PROGRESS!! This book will be written as the Pibrary platform expands.  TRASH ROBOT will live off the support of the Network and write this.


Is this really the next book?  what exactly is next?  how to get to a successful network.  perhaps physics is not next.  what is next has to make things happen.



Three volumes of Trash Physics:

 - [Volume 1: chaos good school bad, a life in physics](scrolls/lifeinphysics)
 - [Volume 2: Why physics is broken](scrolls/brokenphysics)
 - Volume 3: Trash physics, how we will re-organize physics to recenter our science on living things instead of machines

# Trash [Physics](scrolls/whatisphysics)

Trash Physics uses the fundamental forces of the universe to create all things for free from the living Earth, locally to wherever we are.  

We center physics on the living physical world in our immediate environment. This consists of the energy from the sun and the Earth, the flow of water through our environment, air, soil, living things, and the existing trash of the old civilization we are surrounded by.  Trash physics uses the tools of physics to address how to build a new civilization from the trash of the old, which is based on self-replicating methods by which we transform trash into usable products locally.  

We take the most fundamental thing in our Universe to be the living Earth of which we are a part. We use the traditional tools of physics to build the basis of industry from trash and the living world which can support the rest of society.

In Trash Physics we learn how our world works using the traditions of physics, and then directly apply that specific understanding of the world to building factories which produce mechanical machines built from trash to replicate the factory.  We also build textile mills which produce clothes we give away for free.  We also build engines to drive all other machines.  

Trash Physics is built on top of the Pibrary.  The Pibrary is free media in that it is without property or money.  It still is all based on extraction. But it is given out for free to those who currently have the least and are in public spaces(no property).  The Pibrary should create breathing room for people who live off of operating that network and spreading it.  Pibrary can support the world of building the Trash Physics and Trash Factory libraries.  

**The elements of our universe as trash physicists are:**

 - the sun: its spectrum, its thermodynamics, how the Earth's orbit affects seasons
 - the moon: tides, cycles, orbit, the moon landings,  politics of the moon
 - the earth: size, shape, lat/lons, thermodynamics, structure, rocks
 - the water cycle: sea, vapor/clouds, rain, rivers, streams, lakes, ground water, ice and snow
 - air: wind energy, vacuum pumps, air pressure, nuclear weapons shockwaves, sound waves, content, other gasses(nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, neon,CO2,CO, other rare gasses, ozone, plasma) clouds, lightning
 - heat physics: fire, heat engines, steam, hot air
 - flowing ions, chemistry, solutions, transformation. chemical potential and molecular/atomic transport
 - how energy flows through living things: sun, chemical energy, mechanical energy
 - machine physics: force, power, torque, energy of shafts, motors, rotors, ropes, pulleys, wheels
 - electromagnetic radiation: visible light, radio, low frequency fields, radioactivity, x rays, infrared, UV, photosynthesis
 - force, fields
