The Trash Physics program can exist in any physics or applied physics department.  

 - run an elective lab track for undergrad physics majors which does all physics with trash
 - build and run shops which can be used by the rest of the department which build useful things from trash and deliver them to the research labs and also teaching labs
 - we build demos and experiments from trash
 - we build the tools to build things from trash
 - we build machines from trash which can machine trash to make more machines
 - we create free online content which documents every single element of what we do, from structure to funding to all technical details of all builds
 - we rent a space which is the main trash lab which has one of each machine, prototypes of everything, and small scale production of science instruments
 - we work with all science departments on campus to create a network of freely generated science instruments
 - we create original science demonstrations to be used in all fields of science on campus, all made from trash
 - we work with the campus waste management, surplus and salvage people to recapture waste streams into our stream of useful science equipment
 - we develop new instruments to measure trash and publish them for replication(e.g. x ray measurement of alloys of aluminum)
 - we need space *off campus* where things can be insane, trash can come in and out freely, people can hang out all day
 - we need space on campus to have direct connection with the rest of campus
 

The Trash Physics program can spread to any university.  At its heart is just a Trash Lab, where students build science instruments from trash to distribute to the rest of the campus.  This could be as little as a club, with an office, and the office is filled with trash scavenged from university waste and some basic tools to make it into useful stuff.  

Ideally we will have a machine shop, an electrical shop, a welding shop, and a general lab space, as well as storage and staging areas for accumulation of both trash and finished instruments.  The bigger the lab space and the bigger the budget, the more fundamental R&D we can do.  We build instruments for demonstrations for teaching labs, as well as instruments for *all* fields of science.  We take external donations as well as internal trash.
