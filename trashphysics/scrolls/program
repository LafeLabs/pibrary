The Trash Physics program can exist in any physics or applied physics department.  

 - run an elective lab track for undergrad physics majors which does all physics with trash
 - build and run shops which can be used by the rest of the department which build useful things from trash and deliver them to the research labs and also teaching labs
 - we build demos and experiments from trash
 - we build the tools to build things from trash
 - we build machines from trash which can machine trash to make more machines
 - we create free online content which documents every single element of what we do, from structure to funding to all technical details of all builds
 - we rent a space which is the main trash lab which has one of each machine, prototypes of everything, and small scale production of science instruments
 - we work with all science departments on campus to create a network of freely generated science instruments
 - we work with the campus waste management, surplus and salvage people to recapture waste streams into our stream of useful science equipment
 - we develop new instruments to measure trash and publish them for replication(e.g. x ray measurement of alloys of aluminum)
