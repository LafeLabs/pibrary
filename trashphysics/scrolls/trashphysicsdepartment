# trashphysicsdepartment

Not a department but a program.  Not in physics but in media studies.
 
The Trash Physics department does trash physics.  This is physics centered on the assumption that we can build everything from the local waste streams of the existing global consumer system.  We will directly apply physics to figuring out how to build this world.  To do this we will deploy free wireless networks and free web servers into marginalized communities.  This network will self-support.  It will self-replicate, as other institutions can create their own departments.
