# cosmology
 
 - the most fundamental thing is life itself, we center on how to live better lives
 - physics is the study of the most fundamental elements of reality in relation to life itself
 - trash physics centers all physics research on a civilization built from trash
 - we re-organize knowledge into elements based on our actual physical actions we take with physics to improve our own lives and those of the people around us
 - this means elements include earth, sun, wind, water, soil, slime, trash, plants, animals, fungi, etc.  
 - we apply the tools of physics to these elements.  But the elements themselves are the most fundamental
 - this pushes out anything about the universe which can only be seen in special machines and has no impact on *life*
 - we do not *deny* high energy or cosmology being "true" in some strict and trivial sense.  But we *do* place them very much *below* things like water physics or the thermodynamics of a wood log heating in the sun.  This is a value judgement.  A philosophical choice based on how we wish to actually live our lives in the real world.
