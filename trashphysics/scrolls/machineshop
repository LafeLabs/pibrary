We will build a network of machine shops integrated into scrap dealers who get scrap directly at the point of waste production.  These machine shops will build machines.  Among the products are the machine shops themselves.  We will take in wire coils, magnets, bearings, shafts, gears, belts, pulleys, and use them to build machine shops to make replacement parts for each element of the finished machine.

- We build machines which run from water, sun and wind.  
- small wind turbines which turn shafts to small water drivers of shafts
- aluminum scrap buyer
- brass scrap
- auto junk yard and shop connection, make parts for automotive, locally sourced cars like in Ghana car industry
- steel scrap
- copper motor and wires and electrical scrap
- burning trash engine
- sun powered heat engine
- milling machine
- lathe
- drill press
- sheet metal tools
- shop which can build all the tools in the shop
- each machine is fully documented in detail in free open source books which replicate on the Geometron network
- build arbitrary machines for use directly in the community where the waste material was sourced
- our research is building each of these once and creating the Book of it in the Trash Physics Library
- find local scrap dealers who deal directly with the point of waste
- find master machinists
- build applied physics faculty positions which are based on a research program which buys all the machines initially for a research project on campus
 - network of master machinists to train students
 - trade school programs and workforce development programs as source of workers
 - TIG welder(where to source the gas?), need cryogenic plant to extract argon from air
 - stirling engines
 - liquifiers, refrigerators, pumps, compressors

aluminum random scrap bought for about $1.15 a pound and sold for about $1.34 in current system.  After tens of thousands of miles of shipping it goes back to the shop as a bar stock for about $10 a pound.  Or it gets reduced from bauxite at vast energy expense.  Aluminum cans are about
