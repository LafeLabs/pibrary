Take in electrical trash and use it to build electrical and electronic products for use in the trash applied physics lab, in which we do research on building better machines this way. 

 - make alliances with university waste streams
 - make alliances with household e waste collectors
 - breakouts for screens for dumb geometron control
 - develop a generic interconnect technology which uses robots made from trash to connect chips on boards to other random chips
 - build oscilloscopes from trash
 - study slime, both organic and non organic, as a medium for moving ions around, 3d fabrication of circuits
 - study new fabrication technology which focuses directly on building the control we need for just media and machine control, rather than "computing"
 - geometron hardware roadmap, building full stack geometron processor which directly controls imprinting information into physical matter, fabrication machines, and displays for media
