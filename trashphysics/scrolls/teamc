Gym class. I've been against it forever.  Gym class is a self-replicating system of small minded bullies rewarding the next generation of small minded bullies so they can go on and become gym teachers.  Fuck gym class.   I always hated gym class.  And as with all things like that I did not hate it in a small way, I hated it in a big way.  I hated the very concept of gym class as an idea.  I hated the institution of it.  

As a very young child I was isolated from the conforming structures of school in regard to physical activity.

Then, when I was in school in China I saw a totally different model, where kids just have sports equipment and sort themselves out in terms of playing them on their own without adult control.  Or they had an even more regimented routine where everyone just does simple stretches to warm up and get the blood flowing.  In spite of the supposedly authoritarian nature of the Chinese public school system, their system was much less about domination and control than the American one.
