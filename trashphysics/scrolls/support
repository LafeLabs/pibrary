# support
 
This work is based on the idea that everything should be free.  For this to work, creators need to have everything be free while also distributing our work for free.  If this is just one group of people it doesn't work.  To make it work we need a very diverse collection of people all working together to create a new world at the same time.  

I write books.  I distribute them via the Pibarary free book platform.  I ask for material support of this work.  There are several ways to do this.

 - release your own free(no copyright) books over the platform 
 - promoting your other work on the platform(can be anything: art, music, technology, services, random things, mutual aid) over the pibrary
 - use the network to donate physical books you don't want on your shelf
 - write a grant for pibrary expansion, paying for hardware and the time of those who build the systems and distribute in their communities 
 - donate money directly to creators(my cash app is $trashrobot)
 - find a use for the pibrary and employ a librarian as an employee of your organization
 - provide a safe place for a creator or librarian to exist, work, or live
 - feed a librarian or creator
 - donate hardware to the pibrary(raspberry pi, batteries, solar panels, textiles, etc.)
 - donate mutual aid supplies to a pibrary for direct distribution in their community
 - buy and donate physical books for sale by creators on the pibrary network
