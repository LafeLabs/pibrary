# textiles
 
Do we need to make thread? If we do NOT make thread, we can take donations of ALL clothes and all we need is design, cutting, stitching, no plastics work.  We take all clothing related things as feed stock, but not plastic.  Plastic can be done with copies of Precious Plastic, and plastic eating fungus, other projects.  

It is possible that textiles and plastics are, like mycology and permaculture, things that Trash Physics does not do.  Trash Physics is physics. All these other things are needed for Full Trash Magic, but not for trash physics.
