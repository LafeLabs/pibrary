# the plan
  
I will seed the network and hype the book in the next few weeks.  I only need to seed the *social* network, not all the elements, just *people* replicating *things*.  I will get a strategy for a crowd fund of the book together and try to get as much media coverage as I can.  Try to get on podcasts and shows, live stream, co-live, make tiktoks.  Then I will quit APL and *WRITE* full time, just writing and making tiktoks and casually seeding the network without pushing it until the book is done.  Promote the hell out of the book and get press to generate buzz to get a faculty offer and a million dollar a year grant to run my program which includes someone else actually running it and a contract for me to do what I want and create without a schedule, teaching, or meetings.  

Possible funding for the book can be patreon, book deal with publisher, kickstarter, indiegogo.  hire a marketing company?  hire a publicist and an editor. write a cover letter.  query letter?  go on media.  pitch book to people.


What is next?

 - get an actual node in DC 
 - promote in DC spend time there promoting trash robot
 - promote the book on tiktok
 - try to brainstorm crowd funding with people who know things
 - get a kit to Logan in NYC to start seeding network there


***What do I actually want to do? *** 

 - I want to write the book Trash Physics.  
 - I want to make tiktoks and do live streaming
 - I want to talk to smart people about ideas that matter
 - I want to talk shit about physics.  
 - I want to imagine a better physics, to rebuild the whole thing from scratch.  
 - I want to tell my story.  
 - I want to tell the world *how* physics is broken and what that means
 - I want to hang out with weirdos: artists, homeless people, traveling kids, prophets, eccentrics, revolutionaries, philosophers
 - I want to get a comfortable faculty position with salary and benefits
 - I want a disposable budget of a few hundred k a year to spend on gear and pay to spread the network
 - I want to not run anything or be responsible for anything
 - I want to invent things at random and share them 
 - I want to take care of myself and avoid offices and labs and clocks and meetings and schedules and powerpoint and business bullshit

***How to do this?***

 - Hype it on tiktok
 - crowd fund
 - get interviews and spread the word, go on every show I can get on
 - get press attention
 - sell books
 - sell more books
 - actually go and do the things and make video content
 - I don't have to do the things over and over, just do them and make the video go viral
 - seed nodes in DC, Philly, NYC, Denver, Anchorage, Bay Area
 - Between now and June seed networks and do appearances, get some crowd funding up
 - in june, quit apl and write full time
 - the book is the pitch for the physics program, sell books to get press to get a faculty offer to implement the program
