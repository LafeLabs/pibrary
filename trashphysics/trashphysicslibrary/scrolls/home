The Trash Physics Library is all the reference materials needed to be a trash physicist.  A trash physicist manipulates the forces of nature to convert trash and living mater into a world of free stuff. We define "free" to mean both that something is not property and that it is freely self-replicating in that anyone can copy it at any time out of readily available trash and living material. 


We start by building up a system of science based around craft projects we build, the Raspberry Pi, and the Arduino.  We then expand this to building more and more sophisticated machines from trash until our whole media are made from trash and then everything is made from trash.  

 - [Book of Arduino](arduino/)
 - [books of python](python/)
 - books of motors
 - books of the arduino icon printer
 - books of skeletron
 - books of bags 
 - books of flags
 - books of electric water and solids
 - books of water mechanics
 - books of heat engines, stirling engine builds


"Books" can mean stories, builds, calculations, directories and articles.  They can also include self-replicating sets(free sets) of other things, including physical things.

## Calculations

 - web calculator pages
 - latex and math papers with python in pre elements, this can be in conjunction with jupyter notebooks but you just copy and paste into the notebook which is throw away, rather than copy the specific format.  Our latex papers are just text, tex, code snippets, and image sets from running the local jupyter notebook
