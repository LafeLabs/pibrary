The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Fortune passes everywhere.  To promote your goods, services, music, art, science or craft, email [operator@trashrobot.org](mailto:operator@trashrobot.org) to post a link to this self-replicating document.  Cardboard signs, cloth flags, and baked clay icon tokens all point to the domain, which points to the Street Book, which points to the various Scrolls which contain links to things we promote, which in turn co-promote to reference back to TRASH ROBOT, closing the loop.
