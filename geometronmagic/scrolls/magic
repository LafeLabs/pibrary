# MAGIC

Our aim is to share technology which makes all of the elements of a good life free for all people everywhere.  The technology we need to do this exists.  From cheap local renewable energy to dense growth of food to safe disposal of waste, we have all the material elements of a life of plenty created by our shared knowledge.  And yet we live lives constantly hounded by scarcity based on activities which are in the process of killing us all.  Why? What is missing from our collective lives?   This work is an attempt to answer these questions and to provide a path forward using new ways of engaging with existing technology to build the social structures needed to get from a path of destruction and scarcity to one of creation and plenty.  

Our current model of how we think of technology and "the economy" is based on production and consumption.  In the modern world, material is extracted from the Earth, is processed into "products", which eventually turn into waste, and then the process repeats.   This process will always produce scarcity, as everyone must compete for the limited resources.  That scarcity is managed by people claiming ownership over the land from which resources are extracted, ownership of the machines which produce products, and control of the workers making the things. 

We cannot continue with this model because in a finite world it will always consume all resources and destroy all life.  We should not continue because it inflicts misery and fear on all but the small group of people who own and/or control the system.  

Furthermore, even things which are not based on this model, like writing books or software which can freely replicate on existing hardware, are forced to conform to the basic logic of this model.  While money no longer literally represents metal dug up from the ground, the *metaphor* of money is still based on that.  No matter what anyone does, we all need money in our existing system to survive.  Under the existing system if a group of people with no money all want to build a thing, they can't do it without someone with money-creation authority blessing the activity.  People can physically do it in theory, but as long as the material needs of survival are controlled by people who demand money for those things no one but the rich can afford the luxury of doing useful things for which there is no monetary incentive.  This means that the more people in society produce things which *don't* require digging things up or doing manual labor, the larger the gap will be between the money production process and actual creation of value.  This is the reason inequality will always get worse as the information economy grows. Everyone in the information economy is making money from replication, while the old economy still runs on production.  The more powerful information technology becomes, the larger this gap will become, and the rate of increase will keep accelerating.  

What we need to recognize in order to move beyond this system is that we must transition from a consumer society to a replication society, and to change our value system to reflect that.  In the last 300 years we have dug up a staggering quantity and diversity of material.  None of what we have dug up to build our shared global industrial civilization in the last few centuries is really "thrown away".  It's all still here, and generally way more of it than we want.  Some of it is in landfills, some of it is in wasteful machines that have not reason to exist other than to keep "the economy" going, and some of it is in poisoned water and soil, but all of it is still around us in some way.  

The laws of physics and chemistry will allow us to re-use all these elements indefinitely just as natural ecosystems have with simpler elements for the duration of life on Earth.  We can in some sense think of all the trash, toxic waste and useless junk we have created as the "hardware" on which we want to create the "software" of a just and sustainable future.  In this model, value comes from the power of replication, rather than production.  

In a consumer society, every producer is in competition with every other producer. In a replication society, creators benefit from replication.  This creates an incentive system for creators which is the opposite of the existing one.  If I find a way to extract a poison from a river using simple and readily available materials and transform it into a usable material for building things, it is in my best interest for that to replicate.  I want other people to copy it because only then will *all* the water get cleaned up.  I want other people to copy it because the more people copy it the more people will improve upon it, and I will end up with a vastly superior technology to the one I started with, making the river I live on cleaner than would have been possible without the broader community of creators.  

Replication societies are nothing new. They are much older than the production model.  Any indigenous society which lives in equilibrium with its environment is replication based.  When people living in a forest use a tree to make a boat to hunt an animal, that is a replication economy.  They use culture to replicate the boat-making process, and stewardship of the forest to make sure there are always more trees and animals.  The old boats rot and turn into soil which gets turned back into trees, they teach their children to pass along the system after they die and turn back into soil themselves, and the system replicates.  What we propose here is to take this older and proven social model used by indigenous civilizations and apply it to the materials and principles of modern machines.

So how do we do this?  If all the science needed to build a replication based civilization exists, why are we not doing it now?  To build this world we must recognize what the hard part is about this.  It's not building the things, we know how to do that. It's not organizing people to do things, we also know how to do that.  It's the replication of the *desire* to replicate a thing.  That is what we call "magic" for the purpose of this work.  We use this term because no other term fully expresses the mystery of the process by which we acquire the desire to do a thing.  

Under the current system, desire to replicate plays a minimal or hidden role.  Most people work for money out of fear, create the systems to do that out of greed, and consume based on being controlled by a media which exists for the sole purpose of stimulating consumption.


#### *Magic is replication of desire.*

### *Geometron is the use of geometry to program physical matter*

Geometron = "geometry" + "-tron" = machines of geometry

All technology is based on magic.  Everything we create or build from matter is part of a flow of knowledge and intention from person to person.  Language is the root technology from which all other technology emerges. Language is how we replicate thoughts from one person to another.  When those words or symbols or feelings translate into a replication of intent we call that magic.  Without that magic moment no technology will replicate. Without replication all things die.  Without replication of the desire to make a thing, that thing will be no more.

 - a discussion of why this magic is not "supernatural" in a literal sense, should not be taken to contradict or support any literal belief of any kind, is about *results*
 - transition from a production to replication economy, death of property and money
 - not means of production by agents of replication
 - replication and the failure of money to track value creation
 - media stimulates consumption, is itself consumption
 - industrialism hacks human desire to achieve machine replication
 - fashion textile machines and replication of desire, fashion magic
 - we aim for making machine replication more intentional
 - replication in the martial arts
 - replication of religious scriptures
 - replication in the machines of textiles
 - chaos magic
 - "religion"
 - means of production vs. agents of replication
 - replication replacing production, implications for failure of money due to infinities of value via replication
 - marketing and sales, viral culture, brands
 - social media
 - Life is magic.  
 - Self-replicating ideas are magic.  
 - Symbol magic is symbols which replicate, like a popular brand people copy.
 - Set magic is the creation of collections of things which replicate.
 - All ritual, practical, or ceremonial magic fits this description because it involves both replication of ritual and an intent to replicate a thought in the physical world outside the mind
 - Acts of creation depicted in religious traditions also fall under this definition as any would-be creator is also replicating their intent of creation out into the physical world
 - We can think of capitalism as a form of "number magic" in which systems of numbers replicate themselves
 - Trash magic is self-replicating systems built from trash, which contain the means of their own replication

We aim to build a world where everything is free for everyone everywhere. To do this we need to construct a world of things which are freely replicated.  

For much of the last 100 years, technologists have considered the possibility of what they have called "self-replicating" technology, based on vast systems of machines controlled by computers which mine an ever expanding quantity of raw minerals to build more machines and computers indefinitely.  This has proven to be both impractical as a technology and destructive as an ideology.  The problem with all their models for technology is that they don't consider life itself.  The currently dominant thinkers of our technology system externalize all life, including themselves.  

This ideological gap is not some minor detail or a small correction left out to simplify their models. We have allowed all aspects of society to be taken over by a class of people who externalize all life in their world view and we see the consequences of this everywhere.  

Where do "computers" come from?  No humans in the Turing Machine.  

This represents not some new technology of things which replicate "on their own" but a way of working with physical things which centers the process by which we both teach others to copy those things and replicate the desire to 

Life replicates freely.  An ecosystem can exist in dynamic equilibrium for thousands of years, with things replicating, dying and being regenerated indefinitely.  Technology as it is defined by the dominant ideology of our time is explicitly anti-replication.  It is built on consumption of resources, and the more a thing is copied the more resources it consumes.
