# MAGIC
 
#### *Magic is replication of desire.* 

We aim to build a world where everything is free for everyone everywhere. To do this we need to construct a world of things which are freely replicated.  

For much of the last 100 years, technologists have considered the possibility of what they have called "self-replicating" technology, based on vast systems of dead machines controlled by computers which mine an ever expanding quantity of raw minerals to build more machines and computers indefinitely.  This has proven to be both impractical as a technology and destructive as an ideology.  The problem with all their models for technology is that they don't consider life itself.  The currently dominant thinkers of our technology system externalize all life, including themselves.  

This ideological gap is not some minor detail or a small correction left out to simplify their models. We have allowed all aspects of society to be taken over by a class of people who externalize all life in their world view and we see the consequences of this everywhere.



This represents not some new technology of things which replicate "on their own" but a way of working with physical things which centers the process by which we both teach others to copy those things and replicate the desire to 


Life replicates freely.  An ecosystem can exist in dynamic equilibrium for thousands of years, with things replicating, dying and being regenerated indefinitely.  Technology as it is defined by the dominant ideology of our time is explicitly anti-replication.  It is built on consumption of resources, and the more a thing is copied the more resources it consumes.  

If we are to build a world where everything is free for everyone

 - chaos magic
 - "religion"
 - marketing and sales, viral culture, brands
 - social media
 - Life is magic.  
 - Self-replicating ideas are magic.  
 - Symbol magic is symbols which replicate, like a popular brand people copy.
 - Set magic is the creation of collections of things which replicate.
 - All ritual, practical, or ceremonial magic fits this description because it involves both replication of ritual and an intent to replicate a thought in the physical world outside the mind
 - Acts of creation depicted in religious traditions also fall under this definition as any would-be creator is also replicating their intent of creation out into the physical world
 - We can think of capitalism as a form of "number magic" in which systems of numbers replicate themselves
 - Trash magic is self-replicating systems built from trash, which contain the means of their own replication
