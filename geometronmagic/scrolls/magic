# MAGIC

#### *Magic is replication of desire.*

All technology is based on magic.  Everything we create or build from matter is part of a flow of knowledge and intention from person to person.  Language is the root technology from which all other technology emerges. Language is how we replicate thoughts from one person to another.  When those words or symbols or feelings translate into a replication of intent we call that magic.  Without that magic moment no technology will replicate. Without replication all things die.  Without replication of the desire to make a thing, that thing will be no more.

 - machine replication vs. production
 - a discussion of why this magic is not "supernatural" in a literal sense, should not be taken to contradict or support any literal belief of any kind, is about *results*
 - transition from a production to replication economy, death of property and money
 - not means of production by agents of replication
 - replication and the failure of money to track value creation
 - media stimulates consumption, is itself consumption
 - industrialism hacks human desire to achieve machine replication
 - fashion textile machines and replication of desire, fashion magic
 - we aim for making machine replication more intentional
 - replication in the martial arts
 - replication of religious scriptures
 - replication in the machines of textiles
 - chaos magic
 - "religion"
 - means of production vs. agents of replication
 - replication replacing production, implications for failure of money due to infinities of value via replication
 - marketing and sales, viral culture, brands
 - social media
 - Life is magic.  
 - Self-replicating ideas are magic.  
 - Symbol magic is symbols which replicate, like a popular brand people copy.
 - Set magic is the creation of collections of things which replicate.
 - All ritual, practical, or ceremonial magic fits this description because it involves both replication of ritual and an intent to replicate a thought in the physical world outside the mind
 - Acts of creation depicted in religious traditions also fall under this definition as any would-be creator is also replicating their intent of creation out into the physical world
 - We can think of capitalism as a form of "number magic" in which systems of numbers replicate themselves
 - Trash magic is self-replicating systems built from trash, which contain the means of their own replication

We aim to build a world where everything is free for everyone everywhere. To do this we need to construct a world of things which are freely replicated.  

For much of the last 100 years, technologists have considered the possibility of what they have called "self-replicating" technology, based on vast systems of machines controlled by computers which mine an ever expanding quantity of raw minerals to build more machines and computers indefinitely.  This has proven to be both impractical as a technology and destructive as an ideology.  The problem with all their models for technology is that they don't consider life itself.  The currently dominant thinkers of our technology system externalize all life, including themselves.  

This ideological gap is not some minor detail or a small correction left out to simplify their models. We have allowed all aspects of society to be taken over by a class of people who externalize all life in their world view and we see the consequences of this everywhere.  

Where do "computers" come from?  No humans in the Turing Machine.  

This represents not some new technology of things which replicate "on their own" but a way of working with physical things which centers the process by which we both teach others to copy those things and replicate the desire to 

Life replicates freely.  An ecosystem can exist in dynamic equilibrium for thousands of years, with things replicating, dying and being regenerated indefinitely.  Technology as it is defined by the dominant ideology of our time is explicitly anti-replication.  It is built on consumption of resources, and the more a thing is copied the more resources it consumes.  

If we are to build a world where everything is free for everyone
