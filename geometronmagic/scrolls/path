# The Path of Geometron
 
Geometron is a mendicant order.  That is, we are an order of people who choose to give up building property and money based wealth and to live directly off of the network.  This tradition of network building and then living off of the network is one that has been practiced for thousands of years by various religious orders, and we take that as a guide.  These orders might initially take a vow of poverty but that is not our intent here and it not needed.  Historically, religious orders who started out as mendicants also frequently amassed a great deal of wealth and power, but the basis was always building a social network and then asking for direct voluntary support.  

In order for the network to be truly free, we cannot turn this into a business.  We instead raise grant money to support our operations and ask for material donations from community members for support of both ourselves and network operations.  While much commercial activity can happen *on* our network, the creation, replication and development and maintenance of the network must not be commercial for this to work.  We can also make money by selling physical books, but for this to work, again we have to have a total lack of inhibition on replication of digital books, and that means no copyright and no money for book usage.

We write books about places and things and people.  We travel and replicate all the parts of the system.  Physical media points to web pages which host free books which are mirrors of books developed on free raspberry pi servers and replicated out via Github to the global web pages.  We build the Books of the Streets and share them via physical media, which brings in more people to co-create more books.  We find writers and teach them to spread their books freely on the Network.  We build out a library of books which connect people in local physical areas with each other for the benefit of all.

This is our path, the Path of Geometron. It is a way of existing as creators and keepers of self-replicating knowledge for the benefit of all.  We create a knowledge network which provides for those in the most need and creates value for those who already have resources.  Those we help will help us, and we will help whoever needs the most help, while also helping as many people as we can always.  

We seek to live without property, without money, and without mining.  Initially this is impossible. Our whole world is made of disposable mined materials, all land is controlled by the property system, and most resources like food and medicine are held hostage behind pay walls of money.  

Every time we incorporate another group of people into our network to whom we provide value we create paths to survive without money.   

All that said, before the network gets critical mass, we need to be able to exist with money in order to start building the hardware and training the first generation of people.  This will be done on grants and donations.  The primary means of seeding the network is to find communities who have a need and desire for a local free network like this, building the social network of participants from the list in the "people" chapter, then applying for a grant through some local organization like a public library, university, non profit or local government and working as contractors or employees of whoever gets the grant.  We will apply for grants targeted at addressing the "digital divide", the gap between those with more access to network resources and those with less access. 

Money is available from several sources to address digital divide issues in both urban and rural communities.  There is federal money from several agencies earmarked to address this, various non-profits, state governments, and tribal governments and corporations.  Money from grants will go to paying for our time as people of the network to go into a community and build the free wireless Internet hotpots, free Raspberry Pi computers, free electronic books, free web pages, and freely shared physical media, as well as all the hardware to do this and the operational expenses for the first couple of years.  Part of each grant will be a plan to transition each node from being supported by the startup grant and being supported by the local community based on existing local cash flows.  

Grants for a full setup can range from a few thousand dollars through a few hundred thousand dollars, with from one to a dozen people being involved.  In all cases we avoid starting a new business or non-profit.  We rely on existing local non profits or public institutions like libraries who have already proven to be stable and responsibly managed and are well known in the community as the main vehicles for network construction.  And we rely on existing well established local business for the ongoing financial support structure of the network, building physical infrastructure in direct collaboration with local land owners, local governments, and local businesses.

This is the Path of Geometron, as well as the Path of Trash Magic.  We are building a self-replicating network of deep knowledge localized to communities which has the long term intent of building a whole new civilization centered on these local communities and sourcing all material from local trash streams to eliminate all global supply chains and mining completely.  If we build these local networks for communities of a hundred to a few thousand people, we can build a few million of them to span the whole world.  If we can create a system to build all the media hardware using Geometron fabrication, this system can be the basis of a global information economy without mining which supports all other post-extraction industry.  

This path does not require any government or large corporation to make a policy change.  It does not require building new empires of central power and control.  It only requires that we are able to spread the *desire* to build this system.  This is why we call it Geoemtron Magic and Trash Magic.  Because it is the desire we all carry in our hearts for a better world which forms the basis of this network, not any one piece of technology or group of people.  We do not need solve the hard problems.  We only need to create the spark which inspires people to choose to try to solve the *right* hard problems.  If we can create this spark, we can shake the Universe as we experience it, create a world from sun and trash and the living Earth in which all things are free for all people.  Please join us in this project of creation. 


We want to replicate.  The easiest way to replicate is to attach our replication to existing replication.  To that end we must integrate our system into existing replication systems such as religions and other similar spiritual and cultural traditions.
