This is our path, the Path of Geometron. It is a way of existing as creators and keepers of self-replicating knowledge for the benefit of all.  We create a knowledge network which provides for those in the most need and creates value for those who already have resources.  Those we help will help us, and we will help whoever needs the most help, while also helping as many people as we can always.  

We seek to live without property, without money, and without mining.  Initially this is impossible. Our whole world is made of disposable mined materials, all land is controlled by the property system, and most resources like food and medicine are held hostage behind pay walls of money.  

Every time we incorporate another group of people into our network to whom we provide value we create paths to survive without money.
