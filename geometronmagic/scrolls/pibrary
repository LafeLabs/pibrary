# The Pibrary
 
The Pibrary is a network of free books distributed using the Raspberry Pi, a very cheap open source computer designed primarily for educational use.  The goal of the Pibrary is to be an extension of the public library system into more public spaces and with more free and more local books.   

The Pibrary represents a fully free network, meaning everything is free of copyrights or other intellectual property, everything is available in a public space for use by whoever wants to use it, and everything can be freely replicated by other people in other places.  

The Pibrary is centered on public spaces, meaning spaces anyone can get access to without any restrictions such as public parks or public streets or any other outdoor space which we do not restrict access to based on money.  This can include private property as long as the owners of the property are willing to create a truly open space which welcomes all people regardless of social or economic status on a 24/7 basis.  

The free computing element of the Pibrary consists of mobile raspberry pi computers with portable battery and solar panel as a free community computing resource for use in public spaces by whoever has the greatest need for free access to information.  This is to be an extension of other mutual aid projects like Food Not Bombs which provide basic goods and services for free to the most marginalized people in public spaces.  The solar panels and batteries can be used to power or charge mobile devices, a critical infrastructure need for unhoused or traveling people.  The Raspberry Pis are installed with no private data, no logins, no passwords, and are intended to be used that way so that they can be safely shared.  The only purpose of the Pi is to access the Internet for free, just like a free public computer in a public library.  

The basic Raspberry Pi mobile terminal setup consists of the Pi board which is about the size of a deck of cards and costs about $60, the SD card the operating system is installed on, a keyboard, a mouse, a small mobile screen, a 12 volt lead acid battery, and a solar panel and charger.  The whole system costs about $400 and can all be purchased online from many vendors.   In order to charge devices the kit must also have a 12 volt USB power hub to break out the battery power for charging USB devices.

The Raspberry Pi is also used as a home web server for creating, editing and sharing the self-replicating documents of the Geometron system.  To run a Pi at home we need a lot less infrastructure.  The keyboard and mouse and a standard TV or computer screen can be used once to set it up, it can be powered off of a wall plug, and then run "headless" with no screen or peripherals, accessed over entirely over the network.  This server can be accessed by people anywhere in the world by using port forwarding over the home router or router in a public space to connect it to the outside Internet.  

Internet access is provided for free in public spaces by wireless hotspots with clearly posted log on information.  We can beam Internet into public spaces with directional antennas and wireless network extenders.  All of this physical infrastructure is provided for free by donors from the local community.  It is a public resource.

## Street web architecture

Domain name of street.  Flag points to domain.  Domain hosted on commercial host, mirrors github and home pi.  Remote pi logs onto home pi.  Home laptop moves github.   One Raspberry Pi sits at home on the home wifi with port forwarding. The other Raspberry Pi is mobile, with battery and solar panel and is kept in a public space on a public wifi near many people.  That Pi has a flag and other media like self-replicating tokens pointing to a domain which mirrors the documents being edited.  Writers write books over the network onto the home pi, which replicates to the public web page and also to github backups.  

## Free Books

Free books are the heart of this medium.  The "book" here is somewhat of a metaphor, and generally consists of a set of documents which are bound together by a topic with the logic of a book.  When we say "free books" we mean books which are not covered by copyright, which are released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever to be replicated again and again from one free server to the next.


## Free Computers

We build Raspberry Pi computers using donated Raspberry Pi’s and give them out to the community at large to use as a shared free technological resource.

Each Raspberry Pi has a web server installed along with the PHP language, and a basic cyber magic replicator which can replicate any of the systems of electronic documents described here.

Some Raspberry Pi’s exist out in public spaces to be used as general purpose computers.  Others exist in places indoors where they can be plugged into the wall and online using a home or office business Internet connection.  These can be used as servers visible to the outside world. They can be linked to from global web pages, and replicate to them and back.  

We also set up domains with paid hosting which all host self-replicating document sets, and these freely replicate to one another and from each other to raspberry pi’s and from raspberry pi’s back to them.  

## Free Internet

We provide free wireless Internet in public spaces.  This can be done simply by making a private network public with a widely distributed password, using a space with existing free Internet, or more elaborate means of creating wireless repeater chains with directional antennas from one place to another across the land.  To create free internet in an area with good data coverage we can simply pay for a data plan on a mobile phone and use it to make a hot spot with a password we give out to everyone in the area. 

## Free Web Pages

We make freely replicating web pages made of freely replicating sets of documents which are on open(no private data) web pages accessible through generic domains.  These domains can point to Raspberry Pi servers with port forwarding or to paid hosting accounts(which can then point to the local pi servers).  We always choose domains which link to a physical space and then post public physical media in that space which points to the domain which has free books which engage with the space.

Physical media points to the web pages.  These are flags, coins, signs, any kind of print media which people can freely replicate.

## Free Power

We will build solar, water, and wind power connected to batteries and charging electronics.  This includes both the electronics required to charge the battery in our system and the proper outputs to run various devices, mainly 12 V and 5 volt USB for mobile devices.  Larger installations will have inverters to plug in AC line cord devices.
