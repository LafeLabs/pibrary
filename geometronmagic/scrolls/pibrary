## Street web architecture

Domain name of street.  Flag points to domain.  Domain hosted on commercial host, mirrors github and home pi.  Remote pi logs onto home pi.  Home laptop moves github.   One Raspberry Pi sits at home on the home wifi with port forwarding. The other Raspberry Pi is mobile, with battery and solar panel and is kept in a public space on a public wifi near many people.  That Pi has a flag and other media like self-replicating tokens pointing to a domain which mirrors the documents being edited.  Writers write books over the network onto the home pi, which replicates to the public web page and also to github backups.  

## Free Books

Free books are the heart of this medium.  The "book" here is somewhat of a metaphor, and generally consists of a set of documents which are bound together by a topic with the logic of a book.  When we say "free books" we mean books which are not covered by copyright, which are released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever to be replicated again and again from one free server to the next.


## Free Computers

We build Raspberry Pi computers using donated Raspberry Pi’s and give them out to the community at large to use as a shared free technological resource.

Each Raspberry Pi has a web server installed along with the PHP language, and a basic cyber magic replicator which can replicate any of the systems of electronic documents described here.

Some Raspberry Pi’s exist out in public spaces to be used as general purpose computers.  Others exist in places indoors where they can be plugged into the wall and online using a home or office business Internet connection.  These can be used as servers visible to the outside world. They can be linked to from global web pages, and replicate to them and back.  

We also set up domains with paid hosting which all host self-replicating document sets, and these freely replicate to one another and from each other to raspberry pi’s and from raspberry pi’s back to them.  

## Free Internet

We provide free wireless Internet in public spaces.  This can be done simply by making a private network public with a widely distributed password, using a space with existing free Internet, or more elaborate means of creating wireless repeater chains with directional antennas from one place to another across the land.  To create free internet in an area with good data coverage we can simply pay for a data plan on a mobile phone and use it to make a hot spot with a password we give out to everyone in the area. 

## Free Web Pages

We make freely replicating web pages made of freely replicating sets of documents which are on open(no private data) web pages accessible through generic domains.  These domains can point to Raspberry Pi servers with port forwarding or to paid hosting accounts(which can then point to the local pi servers).  We always choose domains which link to a physical space and then post public physical media in that space which points to the domain which has free books which engage with the space.

Physical media points to the web pages.  These are flags, coins, signs, any kind of print media which people can freely replicate.

## Free Power

We will build solar, water, and wind power connected to batteries and charging electronics.  This includes both the electronics required to charge the battery in our system and the proper outputs to run various devices, mainly 12 V and 5 volt USB for mobile devices.  Larger installations will have inverters to plug in AC line cord devices.
