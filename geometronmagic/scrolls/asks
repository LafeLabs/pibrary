# Crowd Sourcing: Asks
 
I, the author am asking you, the reader, for help in building the things described in this book. Only a single person responding to a single thing here will be enough to make it worth it.  All we need is for each thing to get copied once, then get copied again, and again...but initially just a single copy of each action is needed to scale.

 - find a raspberry pi or buy one and install the system, use it at home
 - find a person with a raspberry pi who will let you install the system on their machine(clean install)
 - build a local Book of Commerce for a place with a directory of all commercial activities in a physical location(extremely local yellow pages)
 - put a raspberry pi server on the Internet using a home network connection
 - buy a domain name for a physical location, install geometron on it, share with the community
 - create a flag, sign or marker for a domain and post it in the physical space referred to 
 - write a book on how to build something useful and release it via the Pibrary network(put in specific asks for things)
 - book on solar power for mutual aid
 - book on free wireless hotspot architecture
 - find someone with a story to tell or a thing to build and co-create with them a book on it, release onto the Network
 - make social media content about how to replicate any part of this system(youtube, tiktok, instagram, hackaday, instructables, your web pages)
 - build a self-contained raspberry pi terminal with battery and solar panel and give away to whoever in your community has the most need for it
 - write a book about a physical place and release it via the Pibrary network
 - clone the code for the pibrary to your own Github repository and 
 - host a robot factory, I will come build robots and give them out to your community with community support
 - a grant proposal(bridge digital divide) for 50-100k to build a free wireless network and pibrary and train a community it its use, collaborating with the author
 - promote the Network using a large platform, promote this work
 - buy a hard copy of this book and give it away in a free book box, book share, book donation, or any public space where physical books are shared
 - print this out and bind it yourself in a three ring binder, give away in a book share
