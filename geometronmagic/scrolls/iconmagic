# Icon Magic

We live in an age when our basic understanding of reality is undergoing radical transformation.  We are also facing critical challenges like climate change which can only be addressed by even more radical shifts in our ways of thinking.  This means we need to be able to think about "things" in the absolute most general possible sense and to work with sets of abstract things in order to create radically new philosophies which will allow us to undergo the needed changes.  

In this section we introduce a general symbolic language for expressing relationships between any collection of "things" in the most abstract sense, using physical media which is part of our system of self-replication.  We use this system to design systems of self-replicating sets.  So we are creating a system of self-replicating media used to describe self-replicating collections of things.  This forms a replacement for money.  In a monetary economy, the most fundamental things we exchange are always numbers.  Money, stocks, barrels of oil, ounces of gold, and so on are all exchanged in numbers and represent a certain quantity of "using up" a finite resource.  We can in some sense think of this as "number magic", since the process constantly replicates the desire to acquire more numbers, to "replicate" a number but only at the expense of someone else.  The media which carries all these numbers is generally either private files in private databases or something like the block chain which publicly tallies numbers.  But in all cases the numbers are not allowed to be copied.  One cannot simply take a column of numbers with 10 units and copy it over and over and give everyone 10 of that thing. 

In contrast to this anti-copying property of money, in symbol magic, we are using symbols to denote the sets of things we want to replicate, to replicate the desire of replication.  So to do this we need only the absolute minimum complexity required to communicate this desire, and then cause someone we are talking to to put in the effort to go copy a thing. This thing might be an action or a physical object.  It might be a huge project which organizes thousands of people to work together or a simple act carried out by one person.  But always our focus is the replication of the desire to carry out some physical action.  At some level this is a form of advertising, of brand manipulation, and these icons can indeed be corporate logos or brands.  

This represents an economic system.  Again, in a monetary economy our media is just the list of numbers and people.  In this system our media is self-replicating physical media which represents things we wish to replicate.  In a monetary economy the fundamental transaction is an exchange of numbers.  You get some of one number and I get some of another number, each of us gets a debit of one thing(like dollars) and each gets a credit of another thing(like gallons of gasoline).  In a symbolic replication economy I show you a symbolic representation of a thing we wish to replicate and do whatever I need to do to replicate the replication.  That is to say, to communicate to you what you need to go replicate it somewhere else. This might be as simple as a domain or hashtag or social media handle which points you to instructions to copy.  Given the Web's ability to create deep knowledge if you know how to find it, this symbolic communication only needs to point to things and replicate intent.  The deep knowledge can all be in online documents(all of which also self-replicate). 

We present an example of a symbolic replication economy here we call "Icon Magic".  In Icon Magic, we create self-replicating Geoemtron glyphs in the web browser which both create symbols in the browser and also create programs which can run on robots made out of trash to print in physical media.  We use this with a simple printer robot made of three DVD drives to print in clay using a nail poked repeatedly in an arrangement of pixels.  The Icon design software in the browser has a simple system of tracing over images found via web image searches, so that no real artistic skill is needed.  Also, the only command needed to create a glyph are up, down, left, right, and the same movements combined with drawing one pixel, so a full understanding of Geometron is also not needed, and this technology can be used by people with no common language or technical skills, just by point and click or simple keystrokes.  

We print in Sculpey polymer clay, which can bake in a regular home oven.  Once a print is baked, a stamp can be made in it's mirror image with another blob of Sculpey.  After this is baked it can be used to stamp out a copy of the original print.  This process allows one print to make many stamps and each stamp to make many copies, so one print can replicate out to hundreds or even thousands of copies.  This is what we mean by self-replicating media.  Anyone anywhere in the world can create a Geometron glyph on any server, which they can then replicate an infinite number of times to every other server in the world.  Each one of these can then be printed on a robot which is itself made from trash and documented for replication on all our servers.  Each print can then replicate out to thousands of final tokens. These tokens are then painted and sanded, so the paint stays in the dimples, and complex colored symbols can be created this way.  Note how this is the opposite of money! Money takes its value from its inhibition of replication.  If everyone in the world can copy as many 20 dollar bills as they want, it becomes worthless.  But in our system, value comes from replication, and the more people copy a piece of media the more it is worth, because it pumps energy into the rest of our replication system from which we derive all value.  

Once these self-replicating icon tokens have been created, we can use them for many things.  They can represent objects, people, ideas, places, game pieces, symbols, actions, brands, or collections of any type of "thing" in the most abstract sense.   We use them to communicate descriptions of relations between groups of things to talk about replication of things.  To do this, we need to arrange them on some surface, and to do that we turn again to Action Geometry as described in the last chapter.  We can create a generalized "board" using sharpie on cardboard with our basic set of geometric shapes.  This can be thought of as a generalized table top game made from self-replicating media.  Self-replicating shapes are used to make the same pattern again and again on cardboard trash, on which the same arrangement of tokens can be displayed and manipulated to communication replication to other people.  This physical media is used in a public space covered by the Pibrary.


A general language for expressing self-replicating sets with self-replicating physical media.

Icon magic is a system of self-replicating media which can be used to represent general collections of ideas in relation to each other.  This is a physical manifestation of a universal language in which any object of any kind(thing, person, place, idea, concept, set, action etc.) can be represented by some symbol, and those symbols can then be arranged on networks of dots linked by line segments in geometric patterns.  

This is general.  The icons can mean anything, and there can be any number of them.  The boards can be of any shape or size or layout, as long as they are geometry which can readily be replicated.  The icons are printed by pressing depressions into clay with a nail controlled using a Trash Robot programmed using Geometron.  

We sew up black cotton flannel bags and store the prints in them.  We then use more clay to create stamps which are imprinted from the prints.  These stamps are then used to make the final icon token, which we 

These depressions can be transferred to another piece of clay which can stamp yet another, and that replicates the clay token.  Tokens are painted and sanded to add color to the depressions.  

This is fully self-replicating.  The boards use simple geometry with holes punched in them in cardboard, so that can be replicated with a marker to another piece of cardboard, which we also punch holes in, so it can replicate again and again.  

So we have a system of fully self-replicating media which can represent any relationship between any kind of thing in the most abstract sense. This can be used to organize thought in a very general sense.  

We use this totally general self-replicating media to represent self-replicating sets which form the basis of our fully replication-based economy.
