Action Geometry is a method of construction using a set of seven self-replicating shapes which contain universal scales and symmetries.  These symmetries and scales allow us to construct these shapes using the language of Geometron, using the tools of classical geometric construction(compass and straight edge) or analytic geometry. 

The simplest way to construct a physical shape set is to already have one and to replicate the whole new set from the old set.  Outlines are traced and cut.  The old shapes are then used to draw the interior lines.

The shapes are as follows:

### Equilateral Triangle

This can be constructed from three intersecting circles:

And the inner triangles constructed by dropping perpendicular segments from each corner to each side:

The square:

A Square can be made from equilateral triangles as follows:

A square can be cut diagonally by drawing a straight line between opposite corners. This makes an isosceles right triangle, which has two 45 degree angles, a 90 degree angle, and a square root of two ratio between the legs and the base.  One of these triangles can be used repeatedly to fill in more and more triangles on another one, filling in a fractal of 45 degree lines, which decrease repeatedly by a factor of the square root of two as they go down:
