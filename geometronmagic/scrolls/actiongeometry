# Action Geometry

In the geometry we learn in school, constructions are through "classical construction", using only the compass and straight edge(without markings, not a ruler).  This represents a method of construction which teaches ideas about geometry but is unlikely to be of practical use.  Conversely, in most practical situations, geometry is generally done using numbers and algebraic equations acting on numbers to describe shapes(analytic geometry).  This makes sense for computer technology and robotics controlled by computers.  In a purely number-driven system, the ability to describe a shape with numbers of inches or degrees is all you need and the machine can go to any coordinate in its available range and precision.  

Action Geometry is a method of geometric construction which uses sets of standard shapes and constructions designed to physically replicate themselves using practical physical media.  We can make these shapes from acrylic, plastics of all kinds, thin cardboard, thick cardboard, wood, paper or stone.  We design constructions which can be replicated based on a sequence of tracing actions using these shapes, and then since we can replicate the shapes and also use them to replicate the construction, we have a fully self-replicating system.  This set of shapes is indented to be as practical and universal as possible.  

The shapes include a 6 inch by 1 inch ruler, a three inch square, a three inch equilateral triangle, an isosceles 120 degree triangle with a three inch base, a 30-60-90 triangle with a three inch long leg, a Golden Triangle with a 3 inch leg, and a Golden Gnomon with a three inch base.

This set can all be generated in the web browser using the symbol magic system, which can save the SVG files which can print from a laser cutter. This is how we can create self-replicating artifacts from trash in a web browser: design shapes in the browser, save to SVG, and either print on a printer, cut out and laminate or print on a laser cutter, then those are used for construction on trash with a marker, a box cutter and duct tape.

This is getting closer and close to our ideal for trash magic of self-replicating media which includes trash.  We are constantly working to close loops of media replication.  For example, we can make cardboard signs with sharpies and Action Geometry constructions which advertise web pages which have scrolls and symbol sets which describe the constructions, which replicate to more cardboard signs which replicate to web pages and so on, creating a loop between cardboard signs with geometry and self-replicating web-based graphics. 

All the shapes can also be constructed using Classical Geometry, or numerical layout with an art or engineering program or a protractor and ruler.  

Examples of the  shapes are as follows:

### Equilateral Triangle

### Laser cut acrylic shape:

This can be constructed from three intersecting circles:

And the inner triangles constructed by dropping perpendicular segments from each corner to each side:

The square:

A Square can be made from equilateral triangles as follows:

![](shapeset/symbolfeed/squareconstruction.svg)

A square can be cut diagonally by drawing a straight line between opposite corners. This makes an isosceles right triangle, which has two 45 degree angles, a 90 degree angle, and a square root of two ratio between the legs and the base.  One of these triangles can be used repeatedly to fill in more and more triangles on another one, filling in a fractal of 45 degree lines, which decrease repeatedly by a factor of the square root of two as they go down:

This is how we construct the isosceles 120 degree triangle from the equilateral triangle:

![](shapeset/symbolfeed/isoc120consctruction.svg)

With that triangle as a source of a 30 degree angle and the square as a 90 degree angle the 30 60 90 right triangle can be constructed from any segment of unit length(including the side of an equilateral triangle):

This is how one constructs the Golden Gnomon from the square:

This set of shapes is self-replicating.  The set taken together can be used to make another set like it from paper, cardboard, or any other material we can cut and draw on.  It can also be inflated and deflated, using the shapes and straight edges to make larger or smaller copies of the whole set with the "unit" having any scale.  This document is part of the larger self-replicating set that is this book.  The electronic files which are used to make laser cut shapes or printed and cut out shapes are replicated using the symbol set replicator as with everything else in Geometron.  The links below are used to create the relevant directory for the set, to replicate the symbol set server into that directory, to copy the data which points from the set on Github, and finally to go to the set replicator page which will replicate the shape set.  From there you can load any shape into the symbol editor, edit it, and save it to download and print on paper or with a laser cutter.

So this is a set of self-replicating sets, all of which are used to create self-replicating geometric constructions out of trash.  

The shape set can be used to construct the ArtBox, which is a box made from trash used to carry around sets of art supplies which are used to replicate other sets of things made from trash.  The details of this kind of Action Geometry construction of self-replicating sets are described in the First Book of Geoemtron, and include building structures out of 6 foot bamboo poles and a system of hooks to carry things from them, along with various cloth artifacts for the system.

We also use Action Geometry to make textile crafts, including wearable crafts like shirts and pants and hats which also form self-replicating media, as they are constructed with the tools of Action Geometry and cut out of trash clothing, making lines of clothing which are themselves self-replicating media made out of trash.

Acrylic shape sets and rulers cut out on a laser cutter are a useful physical product to create and distribute in bulk as we scale the Geometron network.  It costs about a dollar a shape to get them made at Ponoko.com.

As with everything else, the most general and simple self-replicating media is always the most powerful.  For Action Geoemtry this is just using the art supplies we carry around in ArtBox including the shape set to create physical products which people can see which point to the rest of our media.  Cardboard and paper are the two easiest physical media.  Cardboard and sharpie are already one of the most powerful forms of self-replicating media used in society by the most marginalized to communicate with a wide range of passerby.  We are building another layer of self-replicating media on this existing information channel, creating recognizable geometric patterns on cardboard with sharpie using our tool set.  Since this is using an existing flow of cardboard trash and sharpie, if we can create self-replicating geometric constructions on these existing cardboard trash pieces(flying signs), we can create a whole feed of self-replicating media out on the physical street which is outside the property system.  All these signs point to domains which host all the documents in our system which points back to replication of the whole thing.

Making self-replicating geometric art on cardboard is also a soothing ritual, a form of art anyone can do anytime anywhere for any purpose.  The creation of a ritual like this helps to spread our culture and civilization.  Many geometric constructions on cardboard spreading along the streets of the world form a global-sized game board on which game tokens can be placed.  These tokens will be discussed in the Icon Magic chapter.  Complex networks of interlinked maps and text documents  integrate the physical street and its media with our digital self-replicating media.  The Path of Geometron, described in a later chapter, tells how we will build these Street Books using the Map Book format, on our Geometron Magic book tour.
