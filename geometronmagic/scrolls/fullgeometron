# Full Geometron
 
We will make everything from trash, without exception. We will abolish all global supply chains and mining and make things using only the materials in our immediate environment.  Our media will be outside the property system, merely a shared resource which we use to replicate all the things in our replication based economy of trash and sun.  However, all this will take time.  We have to start somewhere.  

We must start with the minimum required to have media which is not property and which can carry the knowledge needed to replicate itself.  That is the Raspberry Pi and the associated systems described in this work.  However, in order for this to get where we need to go, it has to have a *path* forward to full Trash Magic.  We do not have the resources to do the whole thing at once, nor would it be desirable to do so if we did, since large intense efforts tend to create systems which continue to require that form of effort.  

The first phase of the network described here is enough to start, to get natural replication without any external input from grants or startup capital.  The Raspberry Pi can be used to make social media which generates sufficient value both inside the marketplace of money and property and outside of it that it should sustain growth.  When this growth starts to ramp up, however, it will pull more and more materials and energy into the network naturally.  The natural next step after the Raspberry Pi is to start pulling in more mainstream hardware platforms.  This system only needs a web server and the language PHP to work and it can be replicated.  This can be done on Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and any type of Linux.  So ultimately the number of servers can get up into the billions once these start getting switched from private to public use.

Any given server added to our system of common media adds a certain amount of value to a local community. When that amount of value is perceived as being greater than the price of a thing or the value of the thing to its owner, people will naturally start moving hardware from the property system to the Geometron network.  As with all network growth dynamics, the value will continue to increase exponentially with the number of elements on the network.  As we cross more and more thresholds of value, more and more hardware will transfer over.  

Of course, the Raspbery Pi and all these commercial off the shelf machines all still come from a mine.  They all still have a finite life time and are deliberately designed to be unusable after that lifetime.   In some sense using them doesn't solve any real problem of Trash Magic as they still are all bought for money from an unsustainable system.  The next step in our path of conversion is to start using a wider range of hardware so that more and more waste can be used in our system which was on its way to the landfill.  To do this, we must turn to the "Internet of Things".  This jargon term is used to denote putting computers in poorly designed products which should not have computers in them.  Generally they solve no real problem and are designed to break as fast as possible with no possibility to repair.  However they are a fantastic resource for us, since they all have to have basic Internet capability by definition.  

Our task with these devices is to develop processes which are easy to replicate which remove everything that is not needed from these machines, remove all proprietary software and all the hardware other than the basic Internet connectivity parts, and put a stripped down operating system the sole purpose of which is to host Geometron documents.  As with all tasks like this, the way to do this is with a fork of Linux based on other forks designed for this kind of task.  A perfect example of this already widely in use is OpenWrt, which is widely used for making routers useful for all sorts of things.

The path above is sufficient to build our global media network outside the system of property, which can be used to replicate things made from trash, while still feeding off the existing extraction based system.  We now turn our attention to the ultimate goal of freedom from that system.

All of our modern electronics comes from a vast and powerful web of supply which is very centralized, very brittle, and very unsustainable.  Huge quantities of sand with special properties are extracted from the few places in the world where they can be found and transported with oil thousands of miles to the few places in the world where microfabrication happens.  This sand is melted in specialized furnaces into giant crystals of insanely pure silicon, which is sliced into wafers.  The wafers are then put through a mass production process where each wafer has thousands of  chips and each chip has billions of transistors and other components.  These combine to make giant arithmetic engines which have clocks pulsing as fast as possible, generally billions of times a second.  All the functions of our "computer systems" are based on this very fast arithmetic engine.  This all looks a lot like replication, with many dice being stamped out which are identical to one another, but it's not quite the same.  They are replicated, but the whole system is not freely replicated.  Intellectual property, control of supply chains, and access to the vast amount of capital required to build these multi billion dollar facilities all make it so that the *system* is designed not to replicate.  

We must build a new fabrication system from the ground up if we are to free ourselves from the mine and oil system.  To do this, we rethink the purpose of the machines we are building.  We do not want to do arithmetic.  We want to do geometry.  We want our machines to do the absolute minimum work required to make the things we want to make and to display information to humans.  Furthermore, everything we are building is designed to be controlled directly by humans.  When a device is not being used and not carrying out a fabrication task it should do *nothing*, take no energy at all.  When a media machine is displaying a static document, the pixels should be energized, and nothing else.  All action is initiated by a human, and leads to response not based on clocks but on direct sequences of actions which take as long as they take.  

We do not realized how large the inefficiencies are in our current systems because they have seemingly blown up overnight and we have nothing to compare them to.  Also, they grew up in parallel with advances in the fundamental science, so we have no perspective on what is possible with today's science given advances in understanding of things like organic semiconductors or various exotic materials which did not exist in the mid 20th century as the current system was evolving.  Also, the growth of the current system involved vast amounts of extraction to get the various special atoms needed to create novel electronic devices.  

But our whole situation is vastly different now than in the 20th century!  Because of the trash feed, we now have every exotic atom available locally to every single person on Earth.  Wherever any of us are right now at this moment, there is a pile of electronic junk which is all identical in its atomic composition and which has every exotic element from antimony to zirconium not only available but in a well understood and perfectly repeated format.  So while it might be *difficult* to figure out how to use some exotic atom found in a trashed television, in a replication based economy we only need to do it once and then push that media out to the global feed and the whole world gets it for free with no supply chain at all.  This is a situation totally unlike any that has ever existed in human history! We cannot possibly overstate the power of this situation.  Even if our civilization totally collapses, any future civilization which evolves will always take this as a starting point, will not have to mine to create whatever they create.  The product of a globalized consumer society cannot be undone: the redistribution of atomic wealth is permanent.

Also, our economic constraints are totally different than those under which the technology we wish to replace were constructed.
