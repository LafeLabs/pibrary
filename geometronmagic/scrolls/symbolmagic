We create self-replicating sets of symbols in the web browser.  The editor which creates them is self-replicating code the same as all the [cyber magic](scrolls/cybermagic) elements of this system.  

[If there is no symbol set, click the replicator for symbol set at symbolset/replicator.php](symbolset/replicator.php)

### [go into the symbolset directory symbolset/](symbolset/)

To make symbols, you want a Geometron keyboard.  You can tape on labels or use paint pen to add the appropriate symbols to a keyboard:

Or use the soft keys on a touch screen if no keyboard is available.

To move the cursor use the move actions:

This is the menu bar on the Geometron symbol editor:

From left to right these icons mean:

 - save
 - scroll
 - symbol feed
 - style
 - layout
 - shape table
 - keyboard
 - json
 - hypercube
 - font
 - symbol set replicator
 - up link

Save symbols to the feed, then to reload them click on the .svg file in the feed.  You can download .svg files from any Geometron symbol feed, upload them to any other server, click on them to load, and then edit and resave and so on.  This is how symbols replicate and evolve from server to server. Click the big red X's to delete permanently.  Saves also save the .png bitmap format images.  Symbol set replicators replicate sets from one server to another.
