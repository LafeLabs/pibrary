Symbol magic are sets of self-replicating web graphics using cyber magic to make vector graphics and also bitmaps to be replicated across the geometron network.

 - geometric programming in the browser with cyber magic
 - how symbol magic is contrasted with applications like adobe suite
 - work flow 
 - keyboard and soft key controls
 - all the types of action 
 - JSON and how it works, relationship between JSON and SVG, XML structure
 - style
 - building symbolic languages into the hypercube
 - examples: schematic diagrams
 - specifically making the web icons
 - links for replication 
 - replication of symbols, how the replication works

We create self-replicating sets of symbols in the web browser.  The editor which creates them is self-replicating code the same as all the [cyber magic](scrolls/cybermagic) elements of this system.  

[If there is no symbol set, click the replicator for symbol set at symbolset/replicator.php](symbolset/replicator.php)

### [go into the symbolset directory symbolset/](symbolset/)

To make symbols, you want a Geometron keyboard.  You can tape on labels or use paint pen to add the appropriate symbols to a keyboard:

Or use the soft keys on a touch screen if no keyboard is available.

To move the cursor use the move actions:

To change the symmetry use the angle actions:

To change the scale use the scale actions:

To draw use the draw actions:

To change the layer/color use the upper case number line:

Paths can be made with the path actions:

And Bezier curves can be started and terminated with y and u:

Zoom and pan the view with keys in the lower right of the keybaord:

Cursor dot position shows scale:

Cursor line segments show symmetry/angle:

This is the menu bar on the Geometron symbol editor:

From left to right these icons mean:

 - save
 - scroll
 - symbol feed
 - style
 - layout
 - shape table
 - keyboard
 - json
 - hypercube
 - font
 - symbol set replicator
 - up link

Save symbols to the feed, then to reload them click on the .svg file in the feed.  You can download .svg files from any Geometron symbol feed, upload them to any other server, click on them to load, and then edit and resave and so on.  This is how symbols replicate and evolve from server to server. Click the big red X's to delete permanently.  Saves also save the .png bitmap format images.  Symbol set replicators replicate sets from one server to another.  

Actions:

 - create a symbol, save it to the feed
 - save it locally, upload it to another server
 - load it, edit it, save it, upload, repeat
 - create a symbol set with chaos icon link
 - replicate a symbol set from one server to another
