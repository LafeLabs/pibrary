# Magic Books
 
The media which drives this network is the Magic Book.  The Magic Book is a format for electronic books which lends itself to easy replication across the Internet and easy editing.  We use the term "magic" as in all other places in this work to mean that people replicate them themselves.   That is, with simply copy/pasting links and clicking on them in browsers anyone on a network can copy any book from any server to any other server.  

This is not like Google Docs where documents are attached to "users" who log into a cloud server controlled by Google.  We use cloud hosting for public-facing web pages, but they are all able to be read by anyone anywhere in the world freely without any log ins or passwords.  And all these books are created, edited, and shared on the local Pibrary networks hosted on physical Raspberry Pi based web servers which are shared freely in our local physical community.

Also, we are using "book" as a metaphor.  What is a book exactly? How is it different from other media?  A book can be physical or digital, can be a private document or public.  But what distinguishes it from things like articles or news is that it is self-contained and encapsulates a large body of knowledge in a coherent whole.  A book can evolve over time and can get re-written but it has a fundamentally different structure from the news feeds which dominate social media today. Also, we distinguish these books from wiki's like Wikipedia.  Wikis are databases of articles.  These articles are the fundamental element of the whole thing, and are not organized into book structures.  It is hard to write down a clear definition which distinguishes an article from a book, but for our purposes a book is a collection of chapters, each of which is a text document, and all of which add up to some coherent whole.  

All books are released by their authors into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever.  We do not use the kind of restricted licenses favored by Creative Commons or the Free Software Foundation, but explicitly release books under the Public Domain.  

Books, like everything else in the work described here, are self-replicating sets.  That is, collections of things which all replicate as a set easily by anyone on the network.   The main element of these sets are called scrolls and these are just text documents in the Markdown format.  Markdown is a very simple text format which is used in a wide range of online content, which in its simplest form is just raw text, but has a few simple additions like using asterisks for italic, double asterisks for bold, and number signs for headings.  While using a markup language like this with a little bit of syntax is in some ways more complex than the completely point-and-click driven editors like Word or Google Docs, this is designed to make the documents compatible with pure-text formats, which is important for making them easy to replicate and edit as we move them freely across our network.  We believe that the usability cost of Markdown is worth it for the usability gain of being plain human readable text.  The Scroll format used in this work is Markdown converted on-the-fly into HTML using the open source JavaScript library showdown.js.  This allows us to set format parameters like font, size, color, and how text fits in a screen using standard web development methods, adapting the same text document to any look and feel or screen size we want(a huge advantage over pdf).  This reliance on standard web development methods allows us to have our format work well on all web enabled devices from mobile to tablet to desktop to big screens and of course our free public Raspberry Pi computers without any software other than the browser.

While our primary media format is in the web browser, it is also useful to be able to generate physical bound books, also for free distribution.  There are a number of ways to do this, but the one we recommend and are using for this work is LaTeX(pronounced LAY-TECH or LAH-TECH, the "X" is meant to represent the Greek letter "Chi"), and document formatting system developed for the typesetting of technical work.  Like Markdown, this is a human-readable text format in which standard text characters are used to indicate to the computer how format will work.  For example, while Markdown uses asterisks around a word for italic, LaTeX uses a backslash command "\emph" along with curly brackets around whatever goes in italic.  The most important thing about using LaTeX is that for when we create more technical works diving into the physics, engineering and math needed to build the world of full Trash Magic that it makes that easy.  This system is already widely used by technology creators and scientists so while it has a steep learning curve it is useful for the experts we are inviting into this system to create works.  Also, it is compatible with a number of other web-based systems of technical documentation like the Jupyter Notebooks which are an almost universal means of communication now in applied sciences where calculations are done on data using Python or other popular data science languages like R.  Another widely used and open source Javascript library(Mathjax.js) allows us to optionally turn on this math typesetting in the Markdown-driven scroll documents as well, so technical books can be written entirely in the Pibrary format and then moved to LaTeX with the math formatting staying the same.  Conversion from Markdown to LaTeX can be enabled with Pandoc, the "swiss army knife" of document formats(see pandoc.org for details).  Once a book is in the LaTeX format it is compiled into .pdf in whatever book size is appropriate.  We generally use this to compile to two formats: the letter size in the US or A4 in metric countries for printing on standard home or office printers to bind in three ring binders and the 6x9 inch format for binding from print-on-demand publishers.  We use Lulu Press(lulu.com) to create the bound copies in various formats.

The exact means by which books are replicated will be discussed elsewhere, but essentially it is all based on building links to scripts which can be run from a browser which fetch lists of files and use that list to fetch all the files.  The best way to learn how to do this is by example, and the replication of this work will involve directly showing people how to do this in person, via video, and via real time online communication we will be setting up in the coming months.

So far we have discussed the format of the Magic Books but not the purpose or what books we will share first.  The purpose of the library of books we are creating here is to be a repository of all the knowledge needed to build full Trash Magic. This means we need to create a culture with everything that goes along with that: history, philosophy, politics, technology, science, math, and all the wisdom required to be stewards of the land we are a part of.  This system of books also needs to self-support.  This means that as a social media platform it needs to generate economic value measured initially in money which can provide material support to those of us creating and replicating the network. 

The beginning of this library is the books created by the author of this book, Trash Robot.  This includes the Trash Magic Manifesto, the Trash Magic Action Coloring Book, and the first Book of Geometron, as well as this book, Geometron Magic.  Trash Robot is also in the process of creating another book, Trash Physics, which is part memoir, part criticism of the structure of modern physics, and partly the start of a whole library of physics texts based on the principles here and 

THE BOOK OF THE STREET

THE TRASH ROBOT PIBRARY(SELF REPLICATING SET OF BOOKS)

A Magic Book is a collection of self-replicating files organized into a "book" metaphor under a unified title and structure.  The text is on "scrolls" which are text documents.  A book can also have attached to it other self-replicating sets of files such as images, symbols, maps...This chapter will focus on how these books can empower people to build community around actions to immediately improve their lives through both commerce and direct mutual aid.  The books of commerce, the books of place, the books of maps, the books of history the books of people and of cultures, of food and horticulture.  this chapter describes how self-replicating books can form the basis for a functioning social media system, with detailed examples.
