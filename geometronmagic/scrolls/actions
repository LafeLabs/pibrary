# Community Actions

This is a book of direct action.  This is not an appeal to authority or an agenda or policy plan for existing organizations, but a framework for directly choosing to go build what we need to build.  Some of the things we need to build will take millions of people decades to build, and will require vast organizations which we can scarcely even conceive of today.  

All of this starts with simple direct actions using only the resources we have available to us right now.  In this chapter we go through the things we are asking as the creators of this work in order to grow this new economic system to the scale needed to solve global problems.  This requires a delicate balance between finding the *right* people with specialized skills who can build complex machines and dedicate their lives to creating new social structures and spreading our message and philosophy to a broad enough audience to provide community support for our core of creators.  We begin with the small steps that everyone can take.  This is magic, as defined in this work: the replication of desire to build this world, nothing more and nothing less.  Without this, nothing else will work. And if we get enough people to believe, we can do anything.

To spread these ideas, this book itself must replicate as broadly as possible.  This means we want the free digital form in as many formats and languages as possible on as many web pages and computers as possible, shared with as many people as possible.  We also want the physical bound copies from a professional printer to be distributed as widely as possible.  This is where the author's self-interest must be publicly declared: the most straight forward was for me, the author, to live off of this network is for people to buy so many of the physical bound book for dollars that I can live off it.  If I can live off of book sales, I can work on more books without any strings attached, and this will maximize my ability to push all this work to the next level without distractions.   Physical copies need not be purchased, they can be printed and bound yourself, by printing the letter size pdf and binding with a simple loose leaf or spiral binder.  Purchasing books is both to get higher quality bound volumes in a smaller format and to support the author.  

We are looking to saturate certain physical spaces with these ideas in order to activate those spaces into our network.  To do that, we ask people to buy or print as many copies as they feel they can and distribute them for free in public spaces where we aim to spread the network.  These books are not property.  In addition to being free of copyright since they are all published on a Public Domain license, we are asking you to never claim the physical volumes as property but to release them into the commons as well.  All of this is tied to the other physical elements of the network.  Our network is built into the physical street, with physical media and computer and network resources all focused along some area.  We look in that area for anyplace that can naturally hold public books and drop books there.  This includes libraries, book stores, coffee shops, waiting areas of medical offices, lobbies of apartment buildings, art galleries, schools, religious institutions, break rooms in work places, infoshops, "little free libraries", hotel rooms, and community houses.  All of these are strategic placements.  We are always using the placement of the book not to simply find readers at random but as a campaign to activate a specific place, to build a new emergent network of people in that space who share our common purpose.  We aim to place many copies within a couple mile radius of a location, rather than broadly distribute, and always the distribution is a means to an end, where we aim to expand the other physical elements of the network(media and machines).

Beyond the message carried in the book, the next thing we are asking from people who wish to replicate these ideas is the replication of the other physical media, which point to the digital media.  The simplest physical media is the patterns we can create using Action Geometry as a ritual artistic practice.  The simple geometric shapes described in the Action Geometry chapter can be created for free paper, pen and scissors(or even careful folding and tearing).  These can be used to create a whole universe of tiled patterns which can be used to spread the idea of self-replicating geometry.  These are very recognizable, and create a sort of brand identity which can be on any media.  This media can include cardboard signs held by people on the side of the street to wall murals, tattoos, chalk art on sidewalks, 





 - make videos of all the things in the [video list](scrolls/videos)
 - find a raspberry pi or buy one and install the system, use it at home
 - find a person with a raspberry pi who will let you install the system on their machine(clean install)
 - build a street book which is a set of geometron cardboard signs in a public space with a set of game tokens on them left in public, and a self-replicating map book connected to the physical street hosted on a public web page linked from the cardboard, a flag a bag of tokens
 - build a local Book of Commerce for a place with a directory of all commercial activities in a physical location(extremely local yellow pages)
 - put a raspberry pi server on the Internet using a home network connection
 - buy a domain name for a physical location, install geometron on it, share with the community
 - create a flag, sign or marker for a domain and post it in the physical space referred to 
 - write a book on how to build something useful and release it via the Pibrary network(put in specific asks for things)
 - book on solar power for mutual aid
 - book on free wireless hotspot architecture
 - use this platform to advertise your business
 - use this platform to promote your art
 - use this platform to promote your books
 - pay me for a year to spread this network no strings attached
 - pay me to build this network in your space, town, organization, land
 - pay someone else to do this
 - apply for a grant and then pay me
 - build a robot and share it, become a node for distribution of robot icon tokens
 - think of an icon token set, ask for it, let me make it and deliver it, replicate it freely, make an icon token factory based on the set, and replicate it out freely
 - think of an icon design and let me make it
 - ask someone else for an icon design idea and make it for them, let someone else print the thing out on the robot
 - make a shirt and give it away
 - buy the book and give it away
 - create a mixed reality game with the map book
 - create a history book of a place, publish on all platforms
 - find someone with a story to tell or a thing to build and co-create with them a book on it, release onto the Network
 - make social media content about how to replicate any part of this system(youtube, tiktok, instagram, hackaday, instructables, your web pages)
 - build a self-contained raspberry pi terminal with battery and solar panel and give away to whoever in your community has the most need for it
 - write a book about a physical place and release it via the Pibrary network
 - clone the code for the pibrary to your own Github repository and 
 - host a robot factory, I will come build robots and give them out to your community with community support
 - a grant proposal(bridge digital divide) for 50-100k to build a free wireless network and pibrary and train a community it its use, collaborating with the author
 - promote the Network using a large platform, promote this work
 - buy a hard copy of this book and give it away in a free book box, book share, book donation, or any public space where physical books are shared
 - print this out and bind it yourself in a three ring binder, give away in a book share
 
 - more people co-create free books which replicate things and which replicate on the system
 - more people build local web pages and physical media pointing to them for local communities 
 - add supporters who believe in the mission 
 - mutual aid workers add solar power stations, free computers, free wifi

book co-creation:

 - local neighborhood people telling their stories
 - compilation of existing copyright-free books into our system
 - creation of books which replicate technology in the broadest sense: cooking, crafts, growing plants and fungi, medicine creation, circuit fabrication, robots building, organization building, self-documenting this system and its forks, arduino, shelter building, code...
