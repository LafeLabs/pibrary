# Web 1.0

Welcome to Web 1.0. Just simple static web pages.  No users. No logins, no passwords, no encryption, no private data. This is a cardboard sign on the side of the road.  It is a chalk board in a hallway.  Spray paint on a dumpster.  Just simple messages of whatever we want to share with other people, spread out in the physical world.
