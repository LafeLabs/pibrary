The power transferred through an area A in a fluid of density $\rho$ moving at constant velocity v is, in watts:

$$
P = \frac{1}{2}\rho Av^3
$$

The density of water is 1 kg/liter.  This is 0.016 kg/in$^3$, so one half of that is 0.008 kg/in$^3$.  So if velocity is in inches per second, and area is in inches squared, the power is 

$$
P = 0.008 Av^3
$$

For a 1 square inch area, and 10 inches per second flow, we get 8 watts. 30 inches per second is about 200 watts.  So can rain gutters be hundreds of watts?  How many watts to run a lathe? Milling machine? drill press? band saw?
