# what is the edge?

The world is made of networks.  These networks are based on central command of power: large governments and corporations control the flow of energy, information and materials through the world.  The edge of this network is where you are right now, the physical space your body inhabits.   

The Edge Network consists of building a network where control is out on the edges where we all exist, not in New York, London and Moscow.  This means we distribute media directly in public spaces over free and open mesh networks.  It means we use those networks to share technologies we use to build everything we need right where we are.
