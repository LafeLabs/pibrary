# What is the Edge?

The world is made of networks.  These networks are based on central power: relatively small groups of people control the flow of energy, information and materials through the entire world.  The edge of this network is where you are right now, the physical space your body inhabits.   To be on the Edge of the network is to be able to function with as little input of resources or power as possible from the central control nodes.

The Edge Network consists of building a network where control is out on the edges where we all exist, not in New York, San Francisco, London or Moscow.  This means we distribute media directly in public spaces over free and open mesh networks.  It means we use those networks to share technologies we use to build everything we need right where we are.  

We are building a network the purpose of which is to freely share resources.  Whoever has the least resources is the farthest "out" from the power on the network, and that is where we direct all our efforts, to bringing resources to those who have the least, and to doing it using resources as close as possible to where they are and where we are.   

We only use energy immediately around us: solar, wind, and water.  We try to only use materials directly around us, both from waste streams and from donations from the local community. When that is not available we use off the shelf components that are easy to buy rather than custom products.  We are building a new industrial civilization from the broken pieces of the old, where we provide everything people need for free and live within our means in terms of energy and materials.  

All of this starts with a network of freely shared media.  This document describes how to start building that network.  We need to build a network which creates positive value both in the current economic system and in the one to come after we pivot off of mining, oil, money, and centralized power.  The various individual chapters/articles/scrolls of this document detail all the specifics to get a network non-experts can quickly learn to copy up and running and generating value for their community as fast as possible with as few resources as possible.
