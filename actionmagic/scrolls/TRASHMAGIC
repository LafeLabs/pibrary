# TRASHMAGIC
 
Trash magic is the creation of things from trash, along with the desire to replicate those things.  Anything made of trash which people want to copy is Trash Magic. 

The intention of the practice of trash magic is to create a society in which all people can live for free(based entirely on self-replicating technology) without net extraction of raw material from the Earth.  We will abolish all mining and other extraction by 2050.  We will build only from trash, from organic materials grown directly around us, and from the ambient energy of the Sun, the heat of the Earth and flowing air and water.

Everything we build will be constructed using methods of magic described here:
