# ICONMAGIC
 
This is a universal language for expressing self-replicating sets symbolically.  Each element of a set is encoded in a Geometron glyph which is used to program a robot which creates a physical token for that icon.  These physical tokens are arranged on a "board" made up of a network of linked dots on cardboard with sharpie using [ACTION GEOMETRY](scrolls/ACTIONGEOMETRY).

Any set from the other elements of MAGIC can be expressed this way. Boards can be made of any size, any geometric symmetry scheme, and be connected as needed.  

All elements of the system are self-replicating.  Everything is described by [BOOK MAGIC](scrolls/BOOKMAGIC) including the documents on how to replicate themselves.
