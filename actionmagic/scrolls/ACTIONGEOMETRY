# ACTIONGEOMETRY
 
Action Geometry is a way of constructing objects using geometric shapes based on the most commonly observed symmetries and scales of the natural world.  These scales are the square root of two used for 45 degree angles, the Golden Ratio used for things with fivefold symmetry, the square root of three which appears in sixfold symmetry, 2, 3, and 5.  

The basic shapes are all based on a 3 inch standard side and are:

 - 3" equilateral triangle 
 - 3" square
 - 3" isosceles right triangle
 - 3" on the base 120 degree isosceles triangle
 - 3" on the middle length side of a 30-60-90 triangle
 - 3" on the base 108 degree isosceles triangle(Golden Gnomon)
 - 3" on each leg [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_triangle_(mathematics))
 - 1x6" ruler
