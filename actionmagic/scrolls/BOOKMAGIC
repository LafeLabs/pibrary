# BOOKMAGIC
 
Book Magic is sets of electronic text documents organized into a "book" metaphor, along with the means and intention to replicate them.  Text documents are called scrolls and are in the [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  Sets of scrolls are replicated by clicking on the scroll set replicator link from the scroll set page at:

Or click the Chaos Magic icon which looks like this:
