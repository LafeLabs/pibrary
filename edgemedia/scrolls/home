# Edge Media

Media, or the physical means of communication, is the most powerful human technology.  It is the engine which drives all other technologies.  Our media have evolved at an ever-accelerating pace from the invention of written language through the printing press to the latest in mobile device technology.  

Today, we live in a world where the hardware of our global unified media networks is created in an unsustainable way, and the software is built to dominate and control people from centralized nodes of power.  We aim to liberate people from these central networks of control by building independent media networks at the most local level.  We will do this by leveraging the power of cheap, unregulated, and readily available wireless hardware and simple, free open source software, and cheap and open source minimalist hardware which can run web servers.  

This [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) describes how we will build these networks and what they will do.  This is a living document, which we will update as needed as we develop the system. 

Content is what drives every media network.  Our networks must provide value which cannot be found elsewhere.  We must help people directly in their lives, helping them to make a living, entertain each other, find connection, build things, share things, and live rich lives.  To do this we will build a network of operators who curate content on web pages distributed over local networks in publicly accessible physical spaces.

This is not social media.  Our web pages do not have users logging into an automated system to share personal information.  This is a scaling down of traditional mass media to a single human operator delivering content to a small local community in shared public physical spaces over shared wireless networks.  We build web servers for shared public use and maintain libraries of documents to share over those servers, which anyone on a public local wireless network can download, share, and view.  To do this, we create social networks offline of people who have a stake in the community: local business owners, government, non profits, religious institutions, schools, and individuals. These people collaborate by direct communication using existing means(meet in person, use phone calls and text and email) to get content onto the network which helps the most people.

These documents can include any kind of media.  Users drag and drop files into a pair of folders, one for images and one for every other type of media file, which can include text, sound, video, or privately distribute web pages in their own html files.  Sub folders in the "media" folder organize collections of media in any convenient way, allowing users to open only the folders they want to find files to download.  Every device on a network can see the server.  

Servers can be in principle any kind of computer, as long as it is cleansed of any personal information so that security is not an issue.  Any machines used should be thought of as common property of the edge media network rather than belonging to anyone, since they should be assumed to be easily hacked.  However if you are in a trusted private space, private machines can be used, following the instructions on the PI CRUST repository for installing on Mac or Windows.  Servers in public spaces with a TV or projector can also act as clients, with a web browser displayed where everyone in the venue can see.  

The PI CRUST server window has four quadrants.  One is just all the images in the images folder displayed.  One is the Wall, which is like a virtual chalk board, you can just type or delete whatever messages are useful on there.   Another lists all the files, or the folders with collections of files. Click a folder to see files in it, click on the files to download them.  The fourth quadrant is a QR code which people can scan to get the URL from one machine to the next.  Thus linking to the server can pass peer-to-peer in a physical venue, with people scanning the QR code on each other's phones.  

Web 1.0 pages are set up on domain names which indicate a physical place.  These self-replicating web pages are documented at [github.com/lafelabs/web](https://github.com/lafelabs/web).  Flags sewn from black cloth and block letters cut out of felt point to the domains, and can be waved from a public place.   Web 1.0 pages say where and how to find the [PI CRUST](https://github.com/LafeLabs/picrust) servers.  We also spread the URLs of these pages using the self-replicating clay tokens documented in the [Book of Geometron](https://www.trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/) on [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org).

What makes our media have value is the curation of content by operators, and distribution in supporting venues.  Venues and operators support each other. Operators promote venues and venues provide material support to operators.  Librarians find content from creators to deliver to the operators, who then distribute in the venues.  Operators distribute books, articles, stories, myths, instructions on useful skills and education of all kind.  Operators can also operate marketplaces, taking advertising requests from community members by email, text message or verbally or by dropped message in a venue and posting them to an advertisement board.  If someone wants to publish their own content they can email or use a thumb drive or their own server to deliver the files to an operator who will then distribute.  

Our aim is to grow the edge media network. This means we want to keep getting more support of more venues, recruit and train more operators, and more content contributed from librarians and content creators.  We also want to build and expand the hardware, creating solar powered off grid mesh networks and connecting them to the Internet to provide free broadband access in public spaces.  For more information on how to do this, see the free pdf book [Wireless Networking in the Developing World](http://wndw.net/) and the references from there, which includes case studies. Another key resource for building these off grid mesh networks is [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net/), a non profit mesh network in New York City.  The references and links from those pages and some online shopping for solar power and network boxes should be enough to start building infrastructure.  If our network is providing values for venues in the community, they have an incentive to support the physical infrastructure directly.  If they buy the hardware and give it to us, the network builders, we do not have to spend any money so we don't need a corporate structure.  Venue owners can also support us with food, shelter and building materials to expand our community on the Edge Media Network.

We will use the [Edge Physics Network](http://trashrobot.org/edgephysics/) to create the whole system of media technology from trash.  As we do this, we will expand infrastructure in public spaces to include all the elements of self-replicating media.  This means we will be building machines made of trash which can make more machines from trash. For example, machines which cut and mill metal, welders and other metal working tools will be developed which can make more of each machine in the shop.  We will do the same for electronics, creating microfabrication technology which can be built from trash streams and which can make interconnects in trash and grow new circuits to move the entire media production technology out to the edges of the network.  

Part of building public space will be finding ways to reuse old screens as displays on public web servers, making the media more and more of a commonly shared resource.  There is enough waste from the existing stream of consumer media that it is realistic to have more than one web server and more than one operational web browser display than there are human beings on this planet.  This manufacturing hub system built around our media also includes physical media fabrication such as books and long term digital storage media.  

We aim to build a society who can live off of this media network.  We will build and maintain the network, creating and sharing content, maintaining both servers and clients, and teaching new people how to do the same to spread the network.  We will find new talent, help them get on the network and help provide material support for them from the network.  We will find venue owners and build relationships where we help them and they help us.  Venue owners can be private home or land owners, restaurants, offices, local, state, federal or tribal governments, bars, coffee shops, religious institutions, schools, athletic facilities, public libraries, university campuses, or anyone else who controls a space and resources.  

[TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) is the initial creator of this network.  [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) is self-replicating media as well.  That is, it's not exactly an individual or company, it's a collection of media, art, craft and technology artifacts which we can freely spread.  None of the elements are copyrighted, trademarked or patented, so that they can all spread with no inhibitions or central control at all.  The [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) brand consists of rainbows and googly eyes in combination, making a face with a black rectangle for a mouth.  This is so that it can be as recognizable as possible while still being in the Public Domain.  Anyone can make any [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) media and do what they want with it, including selling it, and we sell fashion along with robots, books, and anything else in our collection of projects.
