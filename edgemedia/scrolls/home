# Edge Media

Media, or the physical means of communication, is the most powerful human technology.  It is the engine which drives all other technologies.  Our media have evolved at an ever-accelerating pace from the invention of written language through the printing press to the latest in mobile device technology.  

Today, we live in a world where the hardware of our global unified media networks is created in an unsustainable way, and the software is built to dominate and control people from centralized nodes of power.  We aim to liberate people from these central networks of control by building independent media networks at the most local level.  We will do this by leveraging the power of cheap, unregulated, and readily available wireless hardware and simple, free open source software, and cheap and open source minimalist hardware which can run web servers.  

This [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) describes how we will build these networks and what they will do.  This is a living document, which we will update as needed as we develop the system. 

Content is what drives every media network.  Our networks must provide value which cannot be found elsewhere.  We must help people directly in their lives, helping them to make a living, entertain each other, find connection, build things, share things, and live rich lives.  To do this we will build a network of operators who curate content on web pages distributed over local networks in publicly accessible physical spaces.

This is not social media.  Our web pages do not have users logging into an automated system to share personal information.  This is a scaling down of traditional mass media to a single human operator delivering content to a small local community in shared public physical spaces over shared wireless networks.  We build web servers for shared public use and maintain libraries of documents to share over those servers, which anyone on a public local wireless network can download, share, and view.  To do this, we create social networks offline of people who have a stake in the community: local business owners, government, non profits, religious institutions, schools, and individuals. These people collaborate by direct communication using existing means(meet in person, use phone calls and text and email) to get content onto the network which helps the most people.

These documents can include any kind of media.  Users drag and drop files into a pair of folders, one for images and one for every other type of media file, which can include text, sound, video, or privately distribute web pages in their own html files.  Sub folders in the "media" folder organize collections of media in any convenient way, allowing users to open only the folders they want to find files to download.  Every device on a network can see the server.  

Servers can be in principle any kind of computer, as long as it is cleansed of any personal information so that security is not an issue.  Any machines used should be thought of as common property of the edge media network rather than belonging to anyone, since they should be assumed to be easily hacked.  However if you ain a trusted private space, private machines can be used, following the instructions on the PI CRUST repository for installing on Mac or Windows.  Servers in public spaces with a TV or projector can also act as clients, with a web browser displayed where everyone in the venue can see.  

The PI CRUST server window has four quadrants.  One is just all the images in the images folder displayed.  One is the Wall, which is like a virtual chalk board, you can just type or delete whatever messages are useful on there.   Another lists all the files, or the folders with collections of files. Click a folder to see files in it, click on the files to download them.  The fourth quadrant is a QR code which people can scan to get the URL from one machine to the next.  Thus linking to the server can pass peer-to-peer in a physical venue, with people scanning the QR code on each other's phones.  

Web 1.0 pages are set up on domain names which indicate a physical place.  These self-replicating web pages are documented at [github.com/lafelabs/web](https://github.com/lafelabs/web).  Flags sewn from black cloth and block letters cut out of felt point to the domains, and can be waved from a public place.  Web 1.0 pages say where and how to find the [PI CRUST](https://github.com/LafeLabs/picrust) servers.  

What makes our media have value is the curation of content by operators, and distribution in supporting venues.  Venues and operators support each other. Operators promote venues and venues provide material support to operators.  Librarians find content from creators to deliver to the operators, who then distribute in the venues.  Operators distribute books, articles, stories, myths, instructions on useful skills and education of all kind.  Operators can also operate marketplaces, taking advertising requests from community members by email, text message or verbally or by dropped message in a venue and posting them to an advertisement board.  If someone wants to publish their own content they can email or use a thumb drive or their own server to deliver the files to an operator who will then distribute.
