# Trash Robot Factory 

The factory is a set of things which we replicate.  Replicate the things and give them away.  Replicate them and use them.  Replicate them and sell them.  Replicate them and share them.  Replicate and teach others to replicate.  This is the magic book of the Trash Robot Factory.
