# Flags
 
Use a flag to direct people to web pages from the side of the road/street.  A flag is a physical hyperlink.  It points from a physical street at a scale visible from a car to a web resource.  If a hyperlink is a symbol and a pointer to something, the flag is the same way, with one side being a symbol like the trash robot logo or Raspberry Pi and the other side being a domain.  Flags can be placed on the ground, hung from a tree branch, waved from a trash pole, suspended any which way or worn like a shawl.  

Flags are cut from about 35-38 inch square black cloth, and letters and symbols are cut from solid colored felt or similar cloth of bright rainbow colors.  All letters are cut using the font below which is based on removing small amounts of cloth from squares.  

To assemble a new flag, cut out the black cloth to a square shape, then stitch a hem all the way around.  Cut little slots in the hem so that it can be used to thread small trash ties into, which are 18 inch sections of nylon parachute cord with the ends burned.   First, to get the right pattern, draw out a rough sketch on paper of the web address to get the right spacing and letter size.  Leave a 1 inch gap between letters and plan accordingly to select square size.  Letters should be in order of the rainbow red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple.  Then repeat, and repeat again. After you rough it out on paper, make a square cardboard shape to trace all the felt squares, and trace and cut them all so you have a pile of colored felt squares, one for each letter.  The dots can be about 1.5-2 inch squares of any random color, brighter is better.  Do not neglect the "www" so it's clear it's a web address.

Buy domains, get web hosting, install Geometron.  Replicate all your media to it from the various other sources.  Make a flag and fly it. The flag points to the domain the domain mirrors the documents.  The documents describe physical things being replicated by whoever is waving the flag, and the loop is closed.  This is a hyperlink in a physical social media network.

Wave the flag at intersections. Wave it at the TV cameras. Wave it on social media.  Wave it at a highway on ramp. Fly it at a truck stop.  Hang it out the window of your home.  Fly it from your bus or van or car.  Fly it from the stern of a boat.  Tie it to the fence of a highway overpass.
