# Solar Power Station
 
This is a public solar power charging station for use in mutual aid projects.  The system consists of a large lead acid battery(the same kind as a car battery but smaller), a 20 Watt solar panel, and charging accessories.  The charging accessories includes a charger which can be used to charge mobile devices off of USB.  If the station also includes standard power cords from USB A to USB C and the Apple charger, this station can be used even at night to charge up 4 devices at a time.

It requires some skill to use.  We need to train people to understand the battery cycle, how to charge and discharge it, and how to monitor voltage of both panel and battery.  We also combine this with skeletron to suspend the panel and move it over the course of the day to point directly at the sun using only the trash ties for adjustment.  

There is also some assembly required.  On the 12 volt to USB converter we need to cut off he alligator clips and solder on a barrel power connector, then use tape to insulate and strain relieve it. 
 
The whole system costs $120-$150.  The cables and charger all go in a bag.  Drill holes in the frame of the solar panel and create carrying strap and suspension tie with 6 foot clothesline trash ties.  Use duct tape and cardboard to make shock absorbers around the frame sides.  Use duct tape and more trash ties to create carrying and suspension ties for the battery.

Cut the cord for the 12 volt charger and connect a female barrel connector to it. Crimp or solder, then duct tape or electrical tape.

To get from the "load" output of the charger to anything 12 volt we convert to a male barrel with a custom made cable, soldering and duct taping to get this cable:

This is the cable which goes from the battery to the charger:

The battery we use:

The battery gets duct taped up with a pair of Trash Ties so that it can be carried easily over the shoulder and also suspended from a tripod along with the solar panel.  A Trash Tie is a 6 foot long piece of clothes line with the ends taped to prevent fraying.

The Solar Panel has quarter inch holes drilled in the frame and another pair of Trash Ties used to both carry it over the shoulder when we are moving around and to suspend it from a tripod or anything overhead so that we can constantly tweak the angle and tilt so that it always points more or less directly at the sun.

The tripod is made of 3 bamboo poles, each 6 feet long, with quarter inch holes drilled in each end and the center.  They are tied together at one end with a short Trash Tie, consisting of an 18 inch segment of nylon parachute cord with the ends burned.  Solar panel should also get some padding with cardboard and duct tape so it's not so hard on the outsides, being careful not to cover the black panel part which needs to remain clear.

Get a volt meter and use it to check how the voltage goes down with use and up with charging.  These voltages are not specific to any product but are based on the chemistry of the lead-acid cells which make up this kind of battery(if you choose a non lead-acid this does not apply).
