# Bags
 
Bags are a uniform way to carry around things.  That's all! Bags are sewn from black cloth with a drawstring, and have symbols stitched on from cutouts of felt or other colored cloth(or embroidery).  

To make it, first design it on paper.  Then cut it out from the black cotton flannel or other cloth.  

Cut out trash ties to use for draw strings, big for big bags and small for small bags.  Trash ties are either 6 feet of clothesline terminated with duct tape or 18 inches of nylon parachute cord burned at the ends.
