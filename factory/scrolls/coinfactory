 - [build robot](scrolls/robot)
 - use [raspberry pi](scroll(README.md)) to design coins
 - program [arduino](scrolls/robotcode)
 - [print in clay with robot](iconset/programarduino.html)
 - create stamps from prints
 - create coins from stamps
 - make elemental [bags](scrolls/bags), use them to store prints, stamps, and coins
 - create plastic trash magic with stamps(print in trash) to replicate the system
 - trash has web address of replication instructions, which replicate back to trash on the next cycle and so on
 - as we build the system, replicate stamps on more and more trash, always expanding how much trash we have printed on with the trash robot
 - people see the address and build more robots which print on more trash
