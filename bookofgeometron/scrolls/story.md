# The Story of the Book of Geometron
 
### *past, present and future*

## The Past

The book of Geometron was born out of a deep frustration with every aspect of the structure of our industrial civilization.  I had tried to build technology I was ok with in many different ways and contexts.  I worked in government labs, universities, with big companies, started my own companies, and worked in various industries.  At the end of the day I felt everything I did was counter to my values.  I think we should use technology to always better the lives of as many people as possible all the time.....

 - my path to trash magic
 - writing the trash magic manifesto
 - working on trash robots
 - creating the language of geometron, working in arlington for 2 years, long walks and deep thought
 - the code path from jupyter to processing to p5js to javascript to php to full system
 - earlier attempts to build the book of geometron, full html version on github.io
 - closing the loop with the server, ending up at APL in my shitty job there
 - improving the system, figuring out self-replicating sets, "magic" as a concept
 - the pandemic and drastic improvements in the trash robot designs, path from raspberry pi to arduino 
 - tiktok and the trajectory to making it all much better on there
 - trash robot, rainbow core, brands, action geometry
 - learning about laser cutting, getting some made, sketching a possible business
 - meeting various people on tiktok: mutual aid and direct action, radicals, scholars, philosophers, travelers, artists, activists, indigenous creators, anti-racists

## The Present

Right now, we need people to copy this thing.  

 - get people to build the pi server and train others to use it, share this book and its products
 - make tiktok videos walking through the whole book and its replication actions
 - get other people to copy all the parts and make youtubes of them
 - get the pibrary system into mutual aid hubs: power, wireless network, computers, books
 - convince writers to co-create books on the system and release them 
 - get the network set up in locations with a full loop from physical media to web pages to physical servers to physical networks of humans to physical infrastructure(computers, power, wireless) to documents and then back out to web page and on to the next servers, as well as replicated out via github
 - get some community benefit from the network
 - maple lawn
 - the vine
 - k street
 - us29
 - philly
 - pittsburgh
 - denver
 
## The future

 - living on the network
 - building out strategic network nodes
 - find links, build links, ask for sponsors
 - new york, multiple locations
 - denver
 - san francisco
 - sand hill road
 - east bay
