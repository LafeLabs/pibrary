# The Story of the Book of Geometron
 
### *past, present and future*

## The Past

The book of Geometron was born out of a deep frustration with every aspect of the structure of our industrial civilization.  I had tried to build technology I was ok with in many different ways and contexts.  I worked in government labs, universities, with big companies, started my own companies, and worked in various industries.  At the end of the day I felt everything I did was counter to my values.  I think we should use technology to always better the lives of as many people as possible all the time.  But the structures which determine the set of actions available to us limit our ability to do this.  

After my company fell apart in 2015 I went on a journey to find a way of thinking about technology which I was actually ok with. This ended up creating Trash Magic as described in the Trash Magic Manifesto.  This book was written over the course of a few months of traveling around, in Colorado, Alaska and California, talking to people and thinking and writing a series of blog posts which turned into longer essays and then a coherent book.  The book was self-published on Lulu press as well as released for free as a pdf.

The Trash Magic Manifesto was focused on the broad issues of building a whole new technology from the ground up out of trash.  It focused a bunch on a distant future society as well as physics tasks for the nearer term for fabrication of new technology. 

What happened after that book was published was that I tried to figure out what to do next, how exactly to move from where I was to actually *doing* all this.  And there I kept running into the same problem: computers.  Computers stand between us humans and our technology more and more.  I came to believe more and more as I studied the problem that the *people* who build our modern computer systems are evil. That they stand as an impediment to progress, that no other technology or science project can succeed as long as all communication and machine control is held hostage by their malevolent "tech".  

This began a deeper and deeper exploration of how to deal with information technology in a way that is compatible with my values.  The deeper I got into that the more I believed that not only does the entire system of technologies we call "computers" need to be rebuilt from scratch with vastly different values, but that this task has to come before everything else.  

In the beginning I started to study how to build software out of pure necessity.  I refused to be 



 - my path to trash magic
 - writing the trash magic manifesto
 - working on trash robots
 - creating the language of geometron, working in arlington for 2 years, long walks and deep thought
 - the code path from jupyter to processing to p5js to javascript to php to full system
 - earlier attempts to build the book of geometron, full html version on github.io
 - closing the loop with the server, ending up at APL in my shitty job there
 - improving the system, figuring out self-replicating sets, "magic" as a concept
 - the pandemic and drastic improvements in the trash robot designs, path from raspberry pi to arduino 
 - tiktok and the trajectory to making it all much better on there
 - trash robot, rainbow core, brands, action geometry
 - learning about laser cutting, getting some made, sketching a possible business
 - meeting various people on tiktok: mutual aid and direct action, radicals, scholars, philosophers, travelers, artists, activists, indigenous creators, anti-racists

## The Present

Right now, we need people to copy this thing.  

 - get people to build the pi server and train others to use it, share this book and its products
 - make tiktok videos walking through the whole book and its replication actions
 - get other people to copy all the parts and make youtubes of them
 - get the pibrary system into mutual aid hubs: power, wireless network, computers, books
 - convince writers to co-create books on the system and release them 
 - get the network set up in locations with a full loop from physical media to web pages to physical servers to physical networks of humans to physical infrastructure(computers, power, wireless) to documents and then back out to web page and on to the next servers, as well as replicated out via github
 - get some community benefit from the network
 - maple lawn
 - the vine
 - k street
 - us29
 - philly
 - pittsburgh
 - denver
 
## The future

 - living on the network
 - building out strategic network nodes
 - find links, build links, ask for sponsors
 - new york, multiple locations
 - denver
 - san francisco
 - sand hill road
 - east bay
