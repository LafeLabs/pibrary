## Elements

The Pibrary is a network of free human knowledge carried on free physical infrastructure.  We create physical network infrastructure outside the property system which we share and replicate freely in the world.  This infrastructure includes:

 - Free Raspberry Pi public computers shared in public spaces
 - free wireless repeaters and hotspots shared into public spaces, paid for by donors
 - free shared public web pages and public github repositories
 - free physical commercially bound books shared from person to person in a physical community
 - Freely replicating cybermagic code
 - Free books made up of self replicating sets of Geometron scrolls in "pibrary" format
 - Itinerant Raspberry Pi Librarians who build out more and more nodes of the network using donated materials, supported by hosts.  I am looking for people to host me as a Pibrary Librarian.

## Free Computers

We believe in providing free network resources to everyone at all times, serving the most marginalized first.  To that end we build free Raspberry Pi based portable computers and distribute them for free to people in public spaces where those with the least in our society gather(parks, libraries, street corners, shelters, churches, highway rest stops).  These computers are not owned by anyone. They have no users, no log ins, no private data.  They are simply vessels which can carry self-replicating documents from our system. They are both computers which people can use to access the Internet to surf the World Wide Web and also web servers which can host documents which replicate out to the wider web.  

The basic kit is...
