## Elements

The Pibrary is a network of free human knowledge carried on free physical infrastructure.  We create physical network infrastructure outside the property system which we share and replicate freely in the world.  This infrastructure includes:

 - Free(not property) self-replicating sets of documents which use the "book" metaphor, like this one
 - [Cybermagic Code sets](scrolls/cybermagic.md) carrying the Geometron system
 - Free Raspberry Pi public computers shared in public spaces
 - free wireless repeaters and hotspots shared into public spaces, paid for by donors
 - free shared public web pages and public github repositories
 - free physical commercially bound books shared from person to person in a physical community
 - Freely replicating cybermagic code
 - Free books made up of self replicating sets of Geometron scrolls in "pibrary" format
 - Itinerant Raspberry Pi Librarians who build out more and more nodes of the network using donated materials, supported by hosts.  I am looking for people to host me as a Pibrary Librarian.  


## Free Cyber Magic Books(This Document)

This document is a self-replicating set of documents.  The text documents are called "scrolls" and are in a format called Markdown([markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)), which is a simple type setting language.  Click the pencil icon to edit. The red x links to the scroll deleter.  Deleting is forever, as with all organic media.  The Chaos Magic symbol points to the scroll set replicator.  More replicator links are on the [replicator scroll](scrolls/replicators).

## Free Computers

We believe in providing free network resources to everyone at all times, serving the most marginalized first.  We will assemble kits and give them away to the community for wherever they will do the most good.  This physical hardware is not property. When we give these out we are not gifting them to an individual but releasing them from their bonds as property.  Whenever one of us finds someone who can use the hardware more than we can, we will pass it along to them.  The whole kit below does not need to be purchased if you use existing displays, keyboards, and mice.  Raspberry Pi boards can often be found unused by community members who can donate, everything else is standard computer equipment.

The Raspberry Pi is a computer about the size of a deck of cards costing between 50 and 75 US dollars.  It runs all free open source software, on a flavor of Linux written specifically for the platform called Raspbian.  In order to run a Raspberry Pi, one needs to buy a few accessories, listed below, put it all together in a kit you can carry around, and 


We build free Raspberry Pi based portable computers and distribute them for free to people in public spaces where those with the least in our society gather(parks, libraries, street corners, shelters, churches, highway rest stops).  These computers are not owned by anyone. They have no users, no log ins, no private data.  They are simply vessels which can carry self-replicating documents from our system. They are both computers which people can use to access the Internet to surf the World Wide Web and also web servers which can host documents which replicate out to the wider web.  

Read more about the Raspberry Pi at [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) or the [Adafruit Website adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/), and shop for components at [pishop.us](https://www.pishop.us/).  Also, a great source for screens is [sunfounder.com](https://www.sunfounder.com/).


A good self-contained kit with a wall plug is:

 - [Raspberry Pi 4 4 gb($55)](https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb/)
 - [microSD Card and SD adapter($7)](https://www.pishop.us/product/microsd-card-32-gb-class-10-blank/)
 - [SD card reader($3)](https://www.pishop.us/product/high-speed-micro-sd-card-reader-maximum-128gb-black/)
  - [HDMI Screen($102)](https://www.sunfounder.com/collections/monitors/products/7-inch-hdmi-monitor)
 - [raspberry pi keyboard and mouse, official, from sunfounder($36)](https://www.sunfounder.com/collections/keyboard-gamepad/products/keyboard-mouse)

Assembly with a 12 volt battery driving it in a solar rig:

This should be replaced by some added photos of servers plugged into wall and home server plugged into tv.

## Free Power

This page is a stub.  It has a list of things to buy which are known to work.  It will be added to in real time as we expand the network.  Our goal with this page is to get it to have links to all the things you need to buy to build a solar power station which we can release out onto the street for people to run Raspberry Pi's as well as to charge up all their various devices.  

This is for all kinds of free power, meaning we build it and release it of property into a public space and *also* that we create documents to replicate the whole system, as well as that we use only local energy sources(sun, wind, water, biomass, geothermal).  Initially this will be off the shelf solar electric systems, and will expand over time into other options.

Ultimately we will want the Pibrary to include whole collections of scrolls about off grid power, with detailed instructions for not just a few watt supplies but for much larger off grid systems. We want this for not just solar but hydro power, wind power, geothermal power, biomass power, tidal, or anything else we can think of.  We aim to produce and share off grid micro power infrastructure with people which are not property, which are in public spaces for public use.  We will get off oil a few thousands watts at a time spread across billions of people. 

A bottom-up Green New Deal.
  
**Stuff to buy for simple solar kit:**

 - [solar panel and charger, (Amazon $60)](https://www.amazon.com/SOLPERK-Controller%EF%BC%8C-Automotive-Motorcycle-Powersports/dp/B07TTMF3FZ)
 - [barrel connector pigtails to connect pi screen from battery/charger/solar($9)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0915T6NLL)
 - [12 V 9 A-h lead acid battery($40 Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Rechargeable-Battery-Computer-BX1300LCD-Back-UPS/dp/B07WRXR223/)

## Free Web Pages

Get domain names that are linked to physical spaces that are both *local* and *public* like streets, parks, neighborhoods, rivers, streams, or small towns.  Get hosting for the domain.  Create a new file on the host server called replicator.php and copy the code in [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into it.  Point a browser to [your domain]/replicator.php and wait for the code to replicate.  Now you can replicate scroll sets and pibraries.


## Free Physical Books

Donate books to the community by taking them to the sharing points wherever the Raspberry Pi is being used.  Post books to share on the server, along with contact info and meet in public to exchange.  Publish zines.  Publish your own work.  Share free physical books of all kinds with whoever shares the Raspberry Pi servers.
