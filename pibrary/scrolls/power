# FREE  POWER

This page is a stub.  It has a list of things to buy which are known to work.  It will be added to in real time as we expand the network.  Our goal with this page is to get it to have links to all the things you need to buy to build a solar power station which we can release out onto the street for people to run Raspberry Pi's as well as to charge up all their various devices.  

This is for all kinds of free power, meaning we build it and release it of property into a public space and *also* that we create documents to replicate the whole system, as well as that we use only local energy sources(sun, wind, water, biomass, geothermal).  Initially this will be off the shelf solar electric systems, and will expand over time into other options.

Ultimately we will want the Pibrary to include whole collections of scrolls about off grid power, with detailed instructions for not just a few watt supplies but for much larger off grid systems. We want this for not just solar but hydro power, wind power, geothermal power, biomass power, tidal, or anything else we can think of.  We aim to produce and share off grid micro power infrastructure with people which are not property, which are in public spaces for public use.  We will get off oil a few thousands watts at a time spread across billions of people. 

A bottom-up Green New Deal.
