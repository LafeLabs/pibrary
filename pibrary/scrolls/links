Lists of links are a very powerful medium.  Some links can just be an idea, not an actual hyperlink. 

Types of link lists:
 
 - just descriptions of things, like this list
 - links to wikipedia pages about a subject 
 - links to other scrolls in a given pibrary book/page
 - links to other parts of a forking tree of pibrary pages
 - a bill of materials with links to buy all the parts of a thing
 - links to the personal web pages of people promoting their work
 - links to community resources
 - lists of things available for free(virtual freebox)
 - reading list of books on a topic or theme or purpose
 - links to global code resources like github repositories, raw code
 - links to active PHP replicators(scripts which replicate files)
