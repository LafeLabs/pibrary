# Free People
 
What makes these people free in the sense used in this work is that all of them fill self-replicating roles.  Unlike "jobs", which are attached to a specific person who holds that job to the exclusion of others, all of these roles are intended to replicate freely from one person to the next.  We are all always trying to help other people to copy what we do and spread it along.

This is a network of people sharing knowledge through free books.  The people are the real substance of the network.  The shared purpose of those people are what give the network its structure.  Here we go through the various people we hope to share all this with and why they should get involved, how it can benefit them specifically.

**Public Librarians.**  The Pibrary is an extension of the library system.  The public library mission is make knowledge as free as possible.  The pibrary consists of freely created, edited and shared documents on free hardware maintained in public spaces and available to all.  Public libraries currently serve as a computing and Internet resource for people with no other access.  The Pibrary brings physical computers out to the streets with 24/7 access, taking some load off of the computing resources in the physical library, and extending hours and accessibility of the resource.  By being useful for other communities, the Pibrary can be self-supporting, extending the reach and impact of the library without costing money from the base library budget.  Pibraries also extend the effective collection of the library, as user-generated content is all completely free and openly shared, replicated globally from one to another potentially over billions of servers.  As we scale up, it should be possible for a local public library with almost no budget or resources to have access to a very large collection of free titles. Libraries with maker spaces already have STEM education curriculum and often already have Raspberry pi's, and this network simply adds to the impact of that, adding content to it.

**Authors.**  If you are someone who writes for the common good of humanity who believes in free knowledge without the limits of intellectual property, the Pibrary can be a platform for creating explicitly free work.  As we scale, the intent of this network is to have authors created through direct material support from the communities we serve.  If we can get authors generating knowledge to provide all the good things in life, this will be a self-sustaining system without money. In the short term, it can sustain authors via driving traffic to voluntary support pages like Patreon or links to buy physical copies of books with a profit built in from self-publishing platforms like Lulu press.  No work may be posted unless you relinquish all copyright to public domain. No exceptions.

**Unhoused people.**  This is a mutual aid based network.  This means primarily that we are providing fully free infrastructure and services in public spaces on the streets, directly controlled by the people who need it.  This means we will provide free wifi hotspots, free solar powered device chargers, and free easily portable physical computers you can use 24/7.  It also means that we will be co-creating documents which have all the resources available in the local community including contact information for aid organizations, jobs, housing resources, harm reduction organizations, and anyone else who is providing resources.  It also means we are going to be asking for your help in sharing and growing the network.  If our network grows we will eventually be able to make all the things of a good life free for all people, and the only way to do that is to provide for those who have the least first.  And the way to do that is to incorporate you directly into our emerging community, where you can actively engage and contribute by sharing your own stories and creations with the other readers and creators on the Pibrary network.

**Teachers.**  This system can be used by writing teachers to help students co-create published books directly to their local community as an alternative to papers read only by the teacher.  It can also be used by anyone teaching people how to code as a development environment which can be run in a web browser, then published to the network and shared with the world instantly without any gate keepers.  Rather than learning how to code in a job for a company, we teach people to code by directly building web content immediately and publishing to the network for other people to build on.  Our aim is to transition all teaching from job training to direct creation of useful resources for people's communities.  The Raspberry Pi can save a lot of money as a low cost powerful computing resource, and the more people we share this with the better.

**Traveling kids/dirty kids/crust punks.** Think of the Pibrary as a deep sign, or perhaps "hypersign".  A cardboard sign, cloth flag with url or QR code can point to a web-based mirror of the chaos books.  These books can have *anything* on them.  You can share your stories, share whatever you have to share, to sell, etc.  By forming connections with other people who maintain the networks and are supportive, you can maintain documents for free online with no gate keepers, no censors, no algorithms, no passwords or logins, just free things to share freely which can help get the information out there that you need to get the aid you need to stay happy and healthy on the road.  You have a critical role to play in growing the network, sharing our resources and story with the world.  This is a knowledge network, a linking of people who inhabit shared physical spaces.  You can help us to link up all the social networks which connect in physical crossroads like downtowns and truck stops across the world.  And we can help you by helping to promote direct mutual aid to help you on the road.  In a world without property, you are also the pumping blood of our network, moving physical goods to place to place without money.

**Scientists, mathematicians, academics.**  This is a publication platform with no barrier to entry.  If you produce knowledge you are willing to share freely with humanity, this can be a platform which not only shares what you have created but which is built in such a way that others can immediately build on it.  You can write a totally incomplete paper with most of the important parts missing, and if it gets to the correct collaborators, they can build on it and replicate it back to the network and you'll get back something much better than what you started with.  This is a new way of doing research, where we do not associate documents with individual people but with a process of improvement where all readers and writers are co-creating the work over time.  We advocate letting go of ego and prioritizing progress over personal accolades.  However, this publication is still compatible with career boosting publications as it can be treated like free online archives are now with preprints of articles that eventually go into gate kept peer review journals.  These documents are compatible with the LaTeX system of mathematical type setting, a small modification is all that is required to turn it on(documented here).

**Keepers of indigenous knowledge.** We aim with this knowledge network to bring back a more dynamic living type of knowledge that has existed throughout the world in indigenous cultures for thousands of years.  It is our hope that by bringing free computers, free Internet and free off grid power for it all to communities with posses indigenous knowledge that those people will be empowered to share using this platform, both with each other and with the world.  Our network is a hybrid of oral tradition and digital methods, where community members are all co-creating documents which are then passed along freely to the whole of the community. The world today is in desperate urgent need of indigenous science and technology if we are to restore equilibrium between humanity and the living world.  We need the traditional technology and culture to be able to blend with that of the Internet and computers if we are to navigate the whole of humanity out of our current predicament.  Our intent is to get the hardware into your communities, teach your teachers, elders, and other stake holders how to run and grow the system, and then it becomes your network to shape as you see fit.  We also aim to have the network of off-grid computers and wireless links connect with environmental sensors, putting the living Earth onto the indigenous network in a very literal way, hopefully giving it more of a voice in the affairs of the our world as well.

**Mutual aid workers, harm reduction, street outreach, community organizers.**  The pibrary should have a book dedicated to community resources.  This can be a directory of links to resources, people, places, organizations, jobs, housing, really anything that is freely available to help people out should get cataloged here and that should be actively maintained by all.  Think of this like a phone book for resources for those most in need of those resources(any resources).

**People who have too many physical books.** You know who you are.  You know more than half your books are ones you'll never look at again and don't need but both are not sure which half that is, can't bear the thought of them going into a dumpster due to a library donation drive getting too many books and don't want to lug them all over the place.  What you really want is to get them into the hands of an actual reader who will actually read them.  The pibrary will have book catalogs of physical books which people are willing to give away(not loan!!!).  List whatever books you want, along with either contact info or contact info of someone willing to manage the network of the book exchange.  Then if someone wants a book you have they can ask and you can just pass it along with either a meeting or a drop off at a common location like a coffee shop or public library.

**Artists.** The art you sell does not have to be free, but the media describing it does.  This is a platform on which artists can co-create whole books which catalog the art they create and sell or promote whatever commercial channels they use for that. This is not an advertising platform.  Spam gets deleted. But it is a place where people can create long form exposition of whatever they produce and place all that in the context of other creators' art and craft products.  

**Deep readers.** The knowledge which can only be attained through reading a lot of books is of great value to a library community.  We need people to put together libraries, to organize content, to edit, and to add manuscripts which are already available for free but not widely distributed. We also need people to curate libraries, to figure out exactly what people can benefit from in a given community.  That can only happen with very active participation by people who read a lot, both widely and with some depth into various fields.  Reading lists are of the utmost importance.

**Practitioners of religion/magic/spirituality.**  The books we co-create with the Pibrary network are living documents.  What better way to transmit wisdom could you ask for?  True wisdom does not belong to anyone. True wisdom can withstand the maelstrom of a chaotic co-editing process by potentially billions of readers and writers and end up better than it started.  We ask that you consider sharing what you know and what you have learned from your teachers in this truly free form. 

**Technology creators.** One of the core functions of this knowledge network is to spread the technical knowledge required for people to build a new civilization from the waste streams of the existing one.  This requires a whole new way of creating technology, based on free sharing of knowledge over this network.  Ideally this can be a self-sustaining way to exist in society as a creator of technology.  We can create technology, share detailed documents on how to build it, and it will come back to us with community additions much better than what we built. As the network grows and we build more and more truly free infrastructure (manufacturing, housing, food production, power, etc.) we can eventually fully support ourselves off of this network.  We will release our creations for free into the network and get back more free stuff than we put in as the network effect accelerates innovation.

**Organizers.** The chaos book represents an alternative method of communication which can be very valuable for organizing.  Rather than "news", a chaos book represents a body of knowledge which is bound by a common theme or purpose, not a flow of new information all the time but a reference work of use to all.  You can create manuals for organizing, directories of organizers, and compendiums of community stories and issues by asking for input and compiling it all into chaos books.
