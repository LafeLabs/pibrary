**Public Librarians.**  The Pibrary is an extension of the library system.  The public library mission is make knowledge as free as possible.  The pibrary consists of freely created, edited and shared documents on free hardware maintained in public spaces and available to all.  Public libraries currently serve as a computing and Internet resource for people with no other access.  The Pibrary brings physical computers out to the streets with 24/7 access, taking some load off of the computing resources in the physical library, and extending hours and accessibility of the resource.  By being useful for other communities, the Pibrary can be self-supporting, extending the reach and impact of the library without costing money from the base library budget.  Pibraries also extend the effective collection of the library, as user-generated content is all completely free and openly shared, replicated globally from one to another potentially over billions of servers.  As we scale up, it should be possible for a local public library with almost no budget or resources to have access to a very large collection of free titles. Libraries with maker spaces already have STEM education curriculum and often already have Raspberry pi's, and this network simply adds to the impact of that, adding content to it.

**Authors.**  If you are someone who writes for the common good of humanity who believes in free knowledge without the limits of intellectual property, the Pibrary can be a platform for creating explicitly free work.  As we scale, the intent of this network is to have authors created through direct material support from the communities we serve.
