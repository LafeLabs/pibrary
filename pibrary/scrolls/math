The LaTeX system is part of this.  A simple change in the code made with the code editor can turn on the mathjax javascript library which makes math get typeset.  

We also use the latex system to convert the markdown flies in the Pibrary into pdf's which can be either printed at home or sent to the print-on-demand printer [Lulu Press](https://www.lulu.com/).

Web calculators can be made using the code editor, and these can be self-replicating as with all other elements of the system.  sets of calculators can be in code sets.

Pibraries can be converted entirely to mathematical publication, and moved physically from one math space to another, with a shared library of co-created math papers.
