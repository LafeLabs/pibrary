**Source of grants:**

anyone addressing the "digital divide" 

**What are we going to do?**

Build a library of community generated free web-based books.  These books are in the Geometron format and are hosted on a network of community owned Raspberry Pi based web servers and public-facing web pages linked from physical media in the community.  

**How does the Pibrary help bridge the Digital Divide?**    In a networked society power comes from network centrality.  To increase the power of the most marginalized we will provide all the technology of building a new social network directly to the most marginalized people, placing those who are the most marginalized in the current system in the center of our new network.  These people will be the creators and keepers of the network.  As long as that network creates more value for the community than it costs to support the network keepers, any community that adopts this network can eliminate poverty completely in a local area.  We will work to find whoever has the least resources in a community and to build network structures that direct resources to them until there is no poverty.

**How does the Pibrary benefit the community at large?** Networks create connections.  Connections can create benefit that did not exist before.  In the most crude material sense, this just translates to cash flow for participants in the local economy.  We will connect restaurants with customers from out of town, investors with entrepreneurs, bankers with home buyers, sellers of old junk with collectors of old junk,  readers with book collectors and writers, artists with art buyers, etc.  Each connection made is an increase in commercial activity which would not have happened without the network.  Centralized commercial social media networks take all the excess value and extracts it from local communities to the shareholders of those companies.  By keeping this added value in the community it is possible to create much more value per area and per person than central networks.  This extra value can both benefit all of the most powerful participants in the local economy and with our network centered on physically public spaces and the most marginalized people can direct that value where it is needed to totally eliminate poverty and create vast new wealth.
