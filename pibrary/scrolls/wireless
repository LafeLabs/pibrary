# Free Wireless Internet

We believe that all public spaces should have free wireless internet, with no strings attached, no filters, and no barriers to log on.  To this end, we either volunteer our own home access, get grants and donations to pay for an account somewhere, or get donated Internet from some existing institution like a public library, town government, non profit or religious organization.  

We use commercial off-the-shelf  hardware to create point-to-point links, mesh networks, and local hot spots to get FREE network into public spaces.  Networks should have the network name "pibrary" and the password will also be "pibrary".  This information should be clearly posted in a very visible way in the public space covered by the hotspot, along with information about the pibrary network.  
  
For an example of this kind of network using mesh networking see the community mesh network in New York [nycmesh.net](https://www.nycmesh.net/).  For a LOT more information on community wireless networks see the book [Wireless Networking in the Developing World at www.wndw.net/](http://www.wndw.net/).  

That book has the resources needed to build full networks over long distances and covering large areas.  Part of the process of building out this document, the chaos book of the pibrary is expanding on this section, then re writing it again and again for different installations in different places.  The specifics of how to build free wireless hotspots will vary widely from one place to another.
