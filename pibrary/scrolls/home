*From each according to their weird obsession, to each according to their desire*

The Pibrary(Library + Raspberry Pi) is a platform for sharing free knowledge, the purpose of which is to build a more free world for everyone.  

Anyone who wants to create things for the common good can share their work via this platform.  Part of our work is physically building these platforms and bringing them out to people in need in the physical world.  We believe that the only gap between the world we live in and the world in which all material needs are freely met for all people locally is entirely based on how knowledge is created, shared, and stored in society.  

We believe that the ownership of "information" of any kind is *always* wrong, without exception and without nuance.  We believe in a network not of "users" and "information" but of sets of documents carrying information which are commonly maintained and shared freely by communities.  

These documents are not random databases of information.  They are books created to build our world.  A world is built from the stories we tell each other about who we are and where we came from and how the world works, as well as the methods by which we physically go about our lives.  This library therefore only consists of books which are created and shared explicitly into the *public domain* with *no restrictions whatsoever*.  

Support is not by "selling" books.  We give the books freely with no expectation of compensation.  Rather, our support comes from people supporting our ongoing activities in the real world.  Creators can generate money via a crowd fund platform like Patreon, gofunde or indiegogo or directly via paypal, cashapp or venmo.  They can also sell physical things, or advertise services. The only condition to all this is that the actual media on our system is not property.  E.g. a necklace you sell can be property, but the photograph of it for the ad is not.  As we grow the network, and more people buy into the basic premise of our project, more energy/money will flow into the system, supporting a wider and wider range of creators.  As this happens, those creators will spread the network. 

As our network spreads, our core libraries of knowledge on how to build a world from trash will also spread.  If we build a self-replicating network of non-property servers with no property on them which contain libraries with knowledge to build up industry from only trash, water, living systems, the sun, water, and other local things, this can scale to the whole world and replace the existing system.
