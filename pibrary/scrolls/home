*From each according to their weird obsession, to each according to their desire*

This work is based on the idea that everything should be free.  For this to work, creators need to have everything be free while also distributing our work for free.  If this is just one group of people it doesn't work.  To make it work we need a very diverse collection of people all working together to create a new world at the same time.  

I write books.  I distribute them via the Pibarary free book platform.  I ask for material support of this work.  There are several ways to do this.

 - release your own free(no copyright) books over the platform 
 - promoting your other work on the platform(can be anything: art, music, technology, services, random things, mutual aid) over the pibrary
 - use the network to donate physical books you don't want on your shelf
 - write a grant for pibrary expansion, paying for hardware and the time of those who build the systems and distribute in their communities 
 - donate money directly to creators(my cash app is $trashrobot)
 - find a use for the pibrary and employ a librarian as an employee of your organization
 - provide a safe place for a creator or librarian to exist, work, or live
 - feed a librarian or creator
 - donate hardware to the pibrary(raspberry pi, batteries, solar panels, textiles, etc.)
 - donate mutual aid supplies to a pibrary for direct distribution in their community
 - buy and donate physical books for sale by creators on the pibrary network

The Pibrary(Library + Raspberry Pi) is a platform for sharing free knowledge, the purpose of which is to build a more free world for everyone.  

Anyone who wants to create things for the common good can share their work via this platform.  Part of our work is physically building these platforms and bringing them out to people in need in the physical world.  We believe that the only gap between the world we live in and the world in which all material needs are freely met for all people locally is entirely based on how knowledge is created, shared, and stored in society.  

We believe that the ownership of "information" of any kind is *always* wrong, without exception and without nuance.  We believe in a network not of "users" and "information" but of sets of documents carrying information which are commonly maintained and shared freely by communities.  

These documents are not random databases of information.  They are books created to build our world.  A world is built from the stories we tell each other about who we are and where we came from and how the world works, as well as the methods by which we physically go about our lives.  This library therefore only consists of books which are created and shared explicitly into the *public domain* with *no restrictions whatsoever*.  

Support is not by "selling" books.  We give the books freely with no expectation of compensation.  Rather, our support comes from people supporting our ongoing activities in the real world.  Creators can generate money via a crowd fund platform like Patreon, gofunde or indiegogo or directly via paypal, cashapp or venmo.  They can also sell physical things, or advertise services. The only condition to all this is that the actual media on our system is not property.  E.g. a necklace you sell can be property, but the photograph of it for the ad is not.  As we grow the network, and more people buy into the basic premise of our project, more energy/money will flow into the system, supporting a wider and wider range of creators.  As this happens, those creators will spread the network. 

As our network spreads, our core libraries of knowledge on how to build a world from trash will also spread.  If we build a self-replicating network of non-property servers with no property on them which contain libraries with knowledge to build up industry from only trash, water, living systems, the sun, water, and other local things, this can scale to the whole world and replace the existing system.
