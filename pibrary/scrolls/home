The pibrary is a self-replicating knowledge network of free books propagated using the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), a cheap open source computer we give out for free to the community.    

Our network will ultimately provide everything freely for all people to live a good life. We define "free" as meaning not property of any kind. We build things and release them into the Public Domain with no inhibitions on replication at all.
