# FREE BOOKS
 
What are free books? Free books are books which are not property, and which travel from one person to the next freely.   

Free books include books we give away for free when we find that we have too many books.

Free books include books we bind ourselves as zines and create free content in to pass along.  These zines are not property. So as we pass them along, we physically add to them with notes, drawings, and coloring them in.  

Free books include self-replicating sets of documents hosted on the Raspberry Pi(pibrary book).  This document is a free pibrary book, a collection of scrolls.   Scrolls are which is documents in the [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format which can be edited on a Raspberry pi acting as a web server, read over a web browser, and replicated from any server to any other server.  We can replicate these free books from one Raspberry Pi to the next, and mirror to public facing web pages on the Open Web as well as be replicated through public code repositories on Github.  

Free books can also contain other kinds of self-replicating sets of documents, such as images, Geometron symbols, icons and maps(see the book of Geometron), and computer programs. 

The network of free books does not have users, passwords or log ins.  It is just a network of free *documents*, which replicate from server to server across the whole world as we scale up.
