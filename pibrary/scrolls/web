We post copies of the software over and over on numerous pages, as well as numerous forks from each page.  These pages can all replicate from either public Github repositories, other web pages, or Raspberry Pi servers which are open to the wide web via port forwarding. Any of these copies can host any number of books, libraries of books, and so on in fractal forks which all self replicate from server to server.

We make free web pages for all!  As long as someone is willing to publish a thing into the Public Domain we will add it to our universe of self-replicating documents.
