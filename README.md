Pibrary is a social network of freely shared knowledge to build a world where everything is free(is not property).  We believe that the heart of any great civilization is the library.  The pibrary is a knowledge network of free books propagated using the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)  educational open source computing platform.  Our network will ultimately provide everything for free all people need to live a good life. This book documents the elements of free resources we are distributing now.
